DNS server information can be dynamically configured on hosts (such as Host A) via the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).\n\nIf the server being resolved (name resolution) is a public server on the Internet, it will have a reachable public IPv4 address, and not a private address. The topology shows Gigabit Ethernet connectivity with switches and routers only, with no indication of DSL technology in use for Internet connectivity. \n\nDNS queries originally used only TCP and not UDP, but over time, supported both (UDP for shorter query messages, TCP for longer.) However, the DNS well-known port for both TCP and UDP is 53, not 35",

        "questionText": "The figure shows a typical basic network, with servers, PCs, layer 2 LAN switches, and IP routers. PC1 has opened a web browser to connect to web server S1. In response to a request for a web page, the server sends 1000 TCP segments to PC1. All 1000 TCP segments arrive at PC1 with no problems. However, the window size used on this TCP connection started small and then grew over time while those 1000 TCP segments were being sent. What happens to grow the window size?",
        "explanation": "The key to answering this question revolves around the following key concepts:\n\n\t\n\t\tIn each TCP connection, two independent windowing mechanisms exist: a window of data for sending data from one host to the other, and vice versa. That is, host 1 can send X data to host 2, and host 2 can send Y data to host 1, with X and Y being the two independent windows.\n\t\n\t\tThe receiving host chooses the size of the window; the sending host does not choose the size of the window.\n\t\n\t\tThe receiving host informs the sending host of the current allowed window size by listing the window size in the Window field in the TCP header.\n\n\n\tWith these facts in mind, in this case, PC1 would need to send a TCP segment to server S1. That segment lists the Window field. That value represents the number of bytes server S1 can send for its next window of data for this TCP connection.\n\n\tFor the incorrect answers, two of those refer to PC1 and setting values in a TCP segment sent to server S1. While the general mechanism is correct, those answers refer to fields used for acknowledging data and performing error recovery, rather than managing the size of the window.\n\n\tThe two other answers suggest that the server chooses how large a window to use when sending data. With TCP, the sender does not choose the window size; instead, the sender is granted or given the right to send a window of data as specified by the receiving host, as described earlier.",

In this case, because PC2 sends the message, the source port will be the port PC2 is using, which is port 80. As a result, the correct answer lists PC2 as the sending host, with source port 80.",

The ntp peer command indicates that a device intends to get its time from the configured peer and is willing to give its time to that peer should that peer lose its primary clock source (this is usually configured as a backup configuration). The ntp master command configures a device as an authoritative clock source. This command is usually used along with the ntp server command on core devices to ensure that if the core device loses its primary clock source (as configured with the ntp server command), it can still offer an authoritative clock source to other devices that use it as their primary clock source. In this scenario, R1 would need to be configured with the ntp master 2 command to allow other devices to use it as their time source.",

The goal: disable CDP on the upper link (G1/0/1) and enable it for all others. The engineer creates four solutions they can copy/paste into global configuration mode. Which answer achieves the CDP configuration goal and will not result in any IOS messages about invalid commands?",
        "explanation": "In this specific case, you can achieve the stated goal by enabling CDP by default so that any interface with a subcommand to change the setting will use CDP. Then, you combine that with the interface subcommand that disables CDP on that specific interface, overriding the default. In summary, the question asks to enable CDP on all interfaces but to override that setting for interface G1/0/1.\n\nCDP and LLDP use the same conventions with the run and enable keywords in the commands to enable/disable the protocols. Cisco chose the run keyword for the global commands and enable for the interface subcommands. As a result, the correct config is:\n\n\ncdp run                      ! Global command, default CDP on\ninterface GigabitEthernet 1/0/1\n  no cdp enable              ! Interface subcommand to override default\n\n\n\nTwo incorrect answers begin with a&nbsp;cdp enable&nbsp;command. The question describes a process of pasting the configuration into global config mode. However, IOS would reject the cdp enable command in this mode because it is not a valid IOS global command.\n\nThe other incorrect answer lists the no cdp run command after the interface G1/0/1 command. Even though in interface configuration mode, the IOS recognizes and accepts this valid global command - disabling CDP on all interfaces.",

Also, note that the dir command lists files in the specific directory but does not list the files found in subdirectories.\n\nNext, consider the sequence of events with the three commands issued by the engineer. Both copy commands list the second filename with no directory and just the filename (backup1.txt and backup2.txt). As a result, these copy commands copy the file into the present working directory.

        "explanation": "Multigig Ethernet introduced two new speeds: 2.5 Gbps and 5.0 Gbps. Before introducing multigig in the mid-2010s, the IEEE had released 1000BASE-T (late 1990s) and 10GBASE-T (mid-2000s). The popular 1000BASE-T standard required Cat 5E cabling, and many building owners deployed Cat 5E from wiring closets to locations on each floor. 10GBASE-T requires Cat 6A cabling to reach distances up to 100 meters&mdash;that requirement forced building owners to consider upgrading the Ethernet cabling plant at some expense.\n\nThe IEEE engineered two new Ethernet speeds between 1 Gbps and 10 Gbps that work over the same cabling as 1000BASE-T (Cat 5E) at the same 100-meter distance. Those speeds are 2.5 and 5.0 Gbps. As for the incorrect answers, the IEEE has standards for 10 Gbps using UTP cabling (10GBASE-T). To date, the IEEE does not have UTP-based standards for 2 and 20 Gbps.",

        "explanation": "To review the terms, PD represents Powered Device, referring to the device that needs power. PSE means Power Sourcing Equipment, referring to the switch that supplies power to the PD over the Ethernet cable.\n\nThe question asks about automatic detection for the initial power levels. That process uses the sensing of electrical signals. The PSE and PD create a circuit, with the PSE inducing a current on the circuit. The PD changes the signal by applying a specific amount of resistance. The returning signal, reduced by the electrical resistance applied by the PD, signals to the PSE that a PD exists. Knowing a PD exists, the PSE can supply a small initial current, just enough to allow the PD to initialize enough software to ask for additional power via layer two messages using CDP and LLDP.",

Before introducing multigig in the mid-2010s, the IEEE had released 1000BASE-T (late 1990s) and 10GBASE-T (mid-2000s). The popular 1000BASE-T standard required Cat 5E cabling, and many building owners deployed Cat 5E from wiring closets to locations on each floor. 10GBASE-T requires Cat 6A cabling to reach distances up to 100 meters&mdash;that requirement forced building owners to consider upgrading the Ethernet cabling plant at some expense.\n\nThe IEEE engineered two new Ethernet speeds between 1 Gbps and 10 Gbps that work over the same cabling as 1000BASE-T (Cat 5E) at the same 100-meter distance. Those speeds are 2.5 and 5.0 Gbps. As for the incorrect answers, the IEEE has standards for 10 Gbps using UTP cabling (10GBASE-T).

A site-to-site VPN creates one tunnel, configured on two devices, one at each location. Once the tunnel is functional, all devices at each site can communicate with devices in the other site.\n\nThe remote access VPN options using either IPsec or TLS would not be best given the design. Both&nbsp;require each device to create their own VPN tunnel to each other device. Doing so in this case would require extra unnecessary work and would be difficult to scale and manage long term.\n\nThe other incorrect answer, MPLS VPN, uses a private WAN (MPLS) rather than the Internet, so it does not meet the requirements listed in the question.",

        "questionText": "Which statements are most accurate about using IPsec tunnel mode instead of transport mode? (Choose two answers.)",
        "explanation": "IPsec tunnel mode refers to the scope of encryption. With tunnel mode, the VPN endpoints receive packets created by other hosts. After receiving a packet, if the routing choice directs the packet over the VPN tunnel, the sender encrypts the original unencrypted IP packet. The sender creates a new IP packet with a new IP header. The source and destination of the new packet use the VPN tunnel devices&rsquo; addresses as the source and destination of the packet. The original encrypted packet resides as data in the new packet. Once the receiving tunnel endpoint receives the packet, it extracts the data, which holds the encrypted original IP packet, and decrypts it.\n\nTunnel mode works well for site-to-site VPNs. Site-to-site VPNs must support traffic from many hosts with different IP addresses. Encrypting and later decrypting the original IP packet preserves the original source and destination IP addresses, making it easy to forward the packets after they exit the VPN tunnel.\n\nThe two incorrect answers describe IPsec transport mode. It works well for remote access VPNs for which one VPN connection supports, at most, a single host. One site has only one IP address to serve, implied as one of the tunnel endpoints. So, transport mode, which uses fewer overhead bytes, works well for IPsec remote access VPNs.",

        "explanation": "A site-to-site VPN connects two sites by creating a tunnel between two IT-controlled devices (routers, firewalls, or network access servers.) The VPN remains up and working under normal conditions. The endpoint hosts have no awareness of the existence of the VPN, with IP routing forwarding packets over the VPN and the VPN features encrypting the data. All devices at a site can send traffic over the site-to-site VPN. The two incorrect answers refer to attributes of site-to-site VPNs.\n\nRemote access VPNs support a single device. Sometimes, the host uses VPN client software to create an encrypted VPN connection to a remote site. For instance, a remote worker can use a VPN client on their laptop to create a secure VPN tunnel to the corporate network over the Internet. That VPN supports all packets sent by that one host but not for other hosts at the site. The user at that host can connect with the VPN software, use the connection, and stop it later as needed, as an on-demand service.",

This can happen using direct access to the controller or through a number of application programming interfaces (API).

        "explanation": "The IEEE defines the format and assignment of LAN addresses. The IEEE requires globally unique unicast MAC addresses on all LAN interface cards. To ensure a unique MAC address, the Ethernet card manufacturers encode the MAC address onto the card. The first half of the address identifies the manufacturer of the card. Each manufacturer assigns a MAC address with its own OUI as the first half of the address, with the second half of the address being assigned a number that this manufacturer has never used on another card.The timer &ldquo;(min)&rdquo; indicates how long ago the MAC address was learned or updated. A timers of &ldquo;-&ldquo; means that it wasn&rsquo;t dynamically learned and usually represents the device&rsquo;s own MAC address. A hardware address is 48 bits long, is a Layer 2 address, and is represented in 12 hexadecimal characters (with each representing 4 bits).",

        "explanation": "When a router processes an incoming packet, the router de-encapsulates the packet from the data link frame and then re-encapsulates the packet in a new data link frame before forwarding the new frame. The reason is the changing data link layer addresses and/or interface technologies (Ethernet versus HDLC).&nbsp;\n\n\tIn this case, the question asks how many times the packet will be encapsulated. Note that the packet begins within R1, not from a host outside R1. So, the IP packet will first be encapsulated on R1. From here, it will be sent to R2, which will de-encapsulate the packet from the Ethernet frame and re-encapsulate the IP packet into another Ethernet frame. From here, R3 will de-encapsulate the packet from the Ethernet frame and re-encapsulate the IP packet into an HDLC frame. From here, R4 will de-encapsulate the packet from the HDLC frame and re-encapsulate the IP packet into an Ethernet frame. From there, the frame holding that packet will arrive at R5, which will de-encapsulate the packet from the Ethernet frame and process it. However, R5 will not encapsulate the packet for forwarding again, as R5 is the destination.\n\n\t&nbsp;\n\n\tSo to add them up: R1 (encapsulate), R2 (de-encapsulate/re-encapsulate), R3 (de-encapsulate/re-encapsulate), R4 (de-encapsulate/re-encapsulate) = 4.",

        "explanation": "Ping and traceroute are two great troubleshooting tools that you can use to help resolve a problem. Ping can verify if the destination is reachable, and traceroute can verify the path of a packet. For the two incorrect answers, neither are troubleshooting tools. The OSPF routing protocol allows routers to learn and advertise routing information, and IP static routes allow you to configure routes directly on routers. Neither tests IP connectivity directly.\n\n&nbsp;",

        "explanation": "Five specific criteria are required for a service to be a cloud service:\n\n\t\n\t\tOn-demand self-service: You determine when you want and do not want a service.\n\t\n\t\tBroad network access: The cloud service must be accessible by numerous connectivity options and a fast number of devices should be able to leverage it.\n\t\n\t\tResource pooling: Instead of assigning dedicated resources, such as memory and CPU, to each system, resources can be shared across a set of services, servers, and systems. These shared resources are then dynamically allocated on-demand as a system needs it.\n\t\n\t\tRapid elasticity: A cloud service is very different than an on-premise virtual environment. There are still capabilities like resource pooling on-premise, but with rapid elasticity it&rsquo;s hard to come by. Rapid elasticity makes the pools of resources seem unlimited. New resource requests are completed rapidly.\n\t\n\t\tMeasured service: In a cloud service, utilization is tracked and monitored, which can then be reported on by the operator. This is used for billing but also can be used for other capabilities if needed by an organization.\n\n\n\tBoth agile network access and proactive service are unrelated to a cloud service offering and refer to business architecture principals.",

        "explanation": "An autonomous WAP acts similarly to an access layer switch. However, WAPs normally do not have redundant links back to the distribution switches. So it acts more like a star topology, connecting the Ethernet and wireless clients together. A full-mesh topology is often found between the core and distribution layers of the Cisco three-tier design model. A partial-mesh topology is often found between the distribution and access layers in the Cisco three-tier design model. A hybrid topology is found in many networks today because one topology does not fit all needs throughout the network.",

        "explanation": "You can speed up the changing of all 50 router passwords with a Python script. JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is used for input and output of data; although it can be used in conjunction with a script, it by itself is not a script language. You cannot apply YAML or JSON templates to routers unless there is another mechanism, such as a script, that is being used.",

        "explanation": "Generally, office buildings do not have direct runs to each switch closet from the other closets. Although a full mesh is desirable, sometimes only a partial mesh is achievable. Traditional Ethernet-based networks function in a star topology, starting with a switch and connecting each client as a point on the star. A full-mesh topology is often found between the core and distribution layers of the Cisco three-tier design model. A hybrid topology is found in many networks today because one topology does not fit all needs throughout the network.",

        "explanation": "The ARP request took time for the ARP reply, and during this time, the ICMP timeout threshold was exceeded. This is common on a router, and the following pings should not time out unless the ARP entry is cleared after its TTL expires. The local router will not drop the first packet, mainly because routers don\u2019t normally drop traffic unless instructed to do so. Although the route table could be updating at that moment, it is not probable because this behavior can be replicated. The remote router, like the local router, will not normally drop packets unless instructed to do so.",

        "explanation": "Fast-forward switching offers the lowest level of latency and it is the typical cut-through method of switching. Fragment-free switching can be viewed as a compromise between store-and-forward switching and fast-forward switching. Because fast-forward switching starts forwarding before the entire packet has been received, there may be times when packets are relayed with errors.",

        "explanation": "When shared memory buffering method is used, the frames in the buffer are dynamically linked to the destination port, enabling a packet to be received on one port and then transmitted on another port without moving it to a different queue. This buffering method deposits all frames into a common memory buffer shared by all switch ports, and the amount of buffer memory required by a port is dynamically allocated. In port-based memory, it is possible for a single frame to delay the transmission of all the frames in memory because of a busy destination port.",

        "questionText": "Refer to the exhibit.",
        "explanation": "Basically, a collision domain is a network segment that allows normal network traffic to flow back and forth. In the old days of hubs, this meant you had a lot of collisions, and the old CSMA/CD would be working overtime to try to get those packets re-sent every time there was a collision on the wire (since Ethernet allows only one host to be transmitting at once without there being a traffic jam). With switches, you break up collision domains by switching packets bound for other collision domains. These days, since we mostly use switches to connect computers to the network, you generally have one collision domain to a PC.\nBroadcast domains are exactly what they imply: they are network segments that allow broadcasts to be sent across them. Since switches and bridges allow for broadcast traffic to go unswitched, broadcasts can traverse collision domains freely. Routers, however, don\u2019t allow broadcasts through by default, so when a broadcast hits a router (or the perimeter of a VLAN), it doesn\u2019t get forwarded. The simple way to look at it is this way: switches break up collision domains, while routers (and VLANs) break up collision domains and broadcast domains. Also, a broadcast domain can contain multiple collision domains, but a collision domain can never have more than one broadcast domain associated with it.\nCollision Domain: A group of Ethernet or Fast Ethernet devices in a CSMA/CD LAN that are connected by repeaters and compete for access on the network. Only one device in the collision domain may transmit at any one time, and the other devices in the domain listen to the network in order to avoid data collisions. A collision domain is sometimes referred to as an Ethernet segment.\nBroadcast Domain: Broadcasting sends a message to everyone on the local network (subnet). An example for Broadcasting would be DHCP Request from a Client PC. The Client is asking for a IP Address, but the client does not know how to reach the DHCP Server. So the client sends a DHCP Discover packet to EVERY PC in the local subnet (Broadcast). But only the DHCP Server will answer to the Request.\nHow to count them?\nBroadcast Domain:\nNo matter how many hosts or devices are connected together, if they are connected with a repeater, hub, switch or bridge, all these devices are in ONE Broadcast domain (assuming a single VLAN). A Router is used to separate Broadcast-Domains (we could also call them Subnets \u2013 or call them VLANs). So, if a router stands between all these devices, we have TWO broadcast domains.\nCollision Domain:\nEach connection from a single PC to a Layer 2 switch is ONE Collision domain. For example, if 5 PCs are connected with separate cables to a switch, we have 5 Collision domains. If this switch is connected to another switch or a router, we have one collision domain more.\nIf 5 Devices are connected to a Hub, this is ONE Collision Domain. Each device that is connected to a Layer 1 device (repeater, hub) will reside in ONE single collision domain.",

        "explanation": "This question assesses the fundamental differences between TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol), both Transport Layer protocols.\n\n**TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): Connection-Oriented and Reliable**\n- **Connection-Oriented:** Establishes a dedicated, virtual connection using a three-way handshake before data transmission.\n- **Reliable Data Delivery:** Ensures data integrity and order through mechanisms like segment numbering, acknowledgements (ACKs), retransmissions for lost data, flow control (windowing), and congestion control. It's suitable for applications where data accuracy is paramount (e.g., web browsing, email, file transfer).\n\n**UDP (User Datagram Protocol): Connectionless and Unreliable**\n- **Connectionless:** Sends data datagrams without establishing a prior connection or handshake.\n- **Unreliable Data Delivery:** Provides a \"best-effort\" delivery service with minimal overhead. It does not guarantee delivery, order, or error correction at the protocol level. It's suitable for applications where speed and low latency are more critical than guaranteed delivery (e.g., streaming media, online gaming, VoIP, DNS queries).\n\nTherefore, **Option C** correctly states that TCP is connection-oriented and reliable, while UDP is connectionless and unreliable.",
