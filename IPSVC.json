        "explanation": "PC1 does not have an entry in its DNS cache for www.ciscopress.com, so PC1 needs to resolve the www.ciscopress.com hostname to its corresponding IP address. To do so, PC1 needs to send a DNS request to any known DNS servers,&nbsp;such as&nbsp;64.1.2.3 on the right side of the figure. However, because 64.1.2.3 is clearly in a different network, PC1 needs to send the packet to its default gateway (R1). PC1 does not have an ARP cache entry for R1&#39;s 10.1.1.3 IP address, so PC1 first needs to send an ARP request, which is a LAN broadcast, to learn R1&#39;s LAN MAC address.",

        "explanation": "A recursive DNS lookup occurs when a DNS server forwards requests it cannot answer to additional DNS servers until it finds a valid answer. This original DNS server then relays the response to the DNS client that originated the DNS request. Most common DNS deployments utilize recursive DNS lookups in the form of DNS forwarders.\n\n\t&nbsp;\n\n\tA DNS request is the initial request a DNS client sends to a DNS server.\n\n\t&nbsp;\n\n\tIn the case of a recursive DNS lookup, the DNS server also sends a DNS request to other DNS servers.\n\n\tIn a DNS reply, a DNS server replies to a DNS request with a name-to-address resolution.\n\n\t&nbsp;\n\n\tA DNS cache is the mechanism that enables a DNS client and DNS server to store recent DNS requests to alleviate the need to have to complete the full DNS request and DNS reply process several times for the same name-to-address resolution.",

        "explanation": "A few different commands are typically used to configure basic NTP; they include the ntp server, ntp peer, and the ntp master commands. Specifically:\n\n\tThe&nbsp;ntp server&nbsp;command defines the IP address of some other NTP server, so that the local device synchronizes its time based on that NTP server&#39;s time. Also, a device configured with the ntp server&nbsp;command can act as an NTP server for other devices as well, as long as the device also has some other primary clock source (for instance, as configured with the ntp master command).&nbsp;\n\n\tThe ntp peer command indicates that a device intends to both synchronize its time with the configured peer, and to supply time information back to that peer.\n\n\tThe ntp master command configures a device as an authoritative clock source. This command is usually used along with the ntp server command on core devices to ensure that if the core device loses its primary clock source (as configured with the ntp server command), it can still offer an authoritative clock source to other devices that use it as their primary clock source.\n\n\tIn this scenario, R2 would need to use the ntp server 10.10.10.1 command to use R1 as its primary clock source.",

        "explanation": "IOS keeps an environment variable for the present working directory (pwd) in the IOS filesystem. The IOS dir command lists files and directories in the pwd, but not files in any subdirectories, much like a Windows or Linux shell dir or ls command. Using the cd command, any user who has not changed their pwd to another directory begins with a pwd set to the bootflash:/ directory. (IOS also creates flash: as an alias for bootflash:.) So, the show flash: EXEC command displays the contents of the bootflash: directory with different formatting and detail compared to the dir command. In particular:\n\n\n\tThe dir command lists files and directories in the pwd but not files in subdirectories. The show flash: command lists all files &ndash; those in the pwd plus all in subdirectories.\n\tThe two commands list used and free space in the filesystem differently. The show flash: command lists bytes used and bytes available, while dir lists total bytes and bytes free (available.)",

When a host needs to send a packet, it can do some math based on its own IP address and mask to determine the IP addresses in the same subnet. If the destination is in the same subnet, by definition, no routers separate the hosts, so the sending host can send the packet directly to the destination host. However, if the destination is in a different subnet, the sending host knows it needs to send the packet to a router, because there will be at least one router between the sending host and the destination host.",

        "explanation": "IANA, the RIRs, and various ISPs assigned public address blocks to end-users. Public address refers to addresses and their address blocks that should be unique in the Internet. Routers in the Internet need IP routes to match those public addresses so that the routers can forward packets over the Internet to the correct location. \n\nIANA and the RIRs originally assigned three set sizes of public address blocks, called networks or classful networks. Those followed class A, B, and C rules and were of sizes 28, 216, and 224, respectively.\n\nThe above facts combine to give the reasoning behind the two correct answers. One incorrect answer refers to the sizes of CIDR blocks. IANA, the RIRs, and ISPs could assign any size block with a power of 2. That flexibility meant much less waste in assigning public addresses. \n\nThe answer that mentions reusing the addresses at many companies refers to a feature of private IP networks and does not apply to public IP networks or public CIDR blocks.&nbsp;",

The address is in a class B network, and by definition, class B networks have 16 network bits, with the remaining 16 bits (on the right) being either subnet or host bits.

The prefix length (/23) is the sum of the network bits (16 in this case) and the subnet bits, so there must be 7 subnet bits. The number of host bits is simply 32 - prefix_length, or 9 in this case.

In this case, you can build a problem with 8 + 8 + 8 + something, which totals 24 so far. Of course, you need 5 more to total 29. So, 8 +8 + 8 + 5 represents the number of binary 1s in each octet of the DDN mask. Then, pick the DDN mask value for each octet based on your memory of the nine possible DDN mask values. In this case, you get 255.255.255.248. The octets of 255 each represent eight binary 1s, and the 248 represents five binary 1s and 3 binary 0s.The incorrect answers are just not the correct answer of 255.255.255.248.",

That subnet includes&nbsp;Subnet ID 10.99.88.0/22, range 10.99.88.1 - 10.99.91.254, broadcast address 10.99.91/255.

Which answers accurately describe the zero and broadcast subnets traversed in various pings between the PCs?",
        "explanation": "In any subnetted network, the numerically lowest subnet ID is the zero subnet of that network. The name comes from the fact that in binary, the subnet bits have an all 0s value. In decimal, the zero subnet number always matches the classful network number. The zero subnets in the figure are:\n\n\n\tThe R4 LAN (172.30.0.0/21)\n\tThe R3 LAN&nbsp;(10.0.0.0/14)\n\tThe R1-R2 WAN link (192.168.5.0/30)\n\n\nIn any subnetted network, the highest subnet ID is the broadcast subnet. The name comes from the coincidence that, in a&nbsp;broadcast subnet, the subnet&#39;s&nbsp;subnet broadcast address is the same number as the network-wide broadcast address. Regardless, the broadcast subnets in the figure are:\n\n\n\tThe R1-R4&nbsp;WAN link (192.168.7.128/25)\n\n\nFor instance, the subnet number on the R1-R4 link is 192.168.7.128, with a range of valid addresses 192.168.7.129 to .254, with 192.168.7.255 as the subnet broadcast address. The network-wide broadcast has 255 in the last octet of Class C&mdash;in other words, 192.168.7.255. Therefore, the R1-R4 link is a broadcast subnet. It is the only broadcast subnet in the figure.\n\nFinally, note that the&nbsp;R1-R3 WAN link does not use subnetting because it uses class C addresses with the default class C mask of /24.\n\nPredict the path messages take between any pair of PCs to find the correct answers. Then you can look at the above analysis to see if those packets traversed any zero or broadcast subnets.\n\n&nbsp;",

The addresses and subnets per the figure have already been implemented. You must add a LAN subnet from within that same address range that supports up to 30 hosts. If more than one subnet meets those criteria, you must use the numerically lowest subnet ID. Which answer meets all these requirements?",
        "explanation": "To solve this question, first, you need to identify the range of addresses in the four existing subnets, as listed here:\n\n\n\tR1&rsquo;s subnet uses subnet ID&nbsp;172.16.100.72/29 with subnet broadcast address 172.16.100.79.\n\tR2&rsquo;s subnet uses subnet ID&nbsp;172.16.100.128/26&nbsp;with subnet broadcast address 172.16.100.191.\n\tR3&rsquo;s subnet uses subnet ID&nbsp;172.16.100.16/28&nbsp;with subnet broadcast address 172.16.100.31.\n\tR4&rsquo;s subnet uses subnet ID&nbsp;172.16.100.96/27&nbsp;with subnet broadcast address 172.16.100.127.\n\n\nNext, you must identify a mask providing 30 hosts/subnet. A mask of /27 leaves 5 host bits, implying 25 - 2 or 30 hosts/subnet, providing the exact number of addresses needed. A mask of /28 (as per two answers) needs to supply more hosts per subnet, with only 4 host bits.\n\nThen, calculate the possible subnets in this address range using the /27 mask. Those include:\n\n\n\t172.16.100.0/27 (subnet broadcast .31)\n\t172.16.100.32/27 (subnet broadcast .63)\n\t172.16.100.64/27 (subnet broadcast .95)\n\t172.16.100.96/27 (subnet broadcast .127)\n\t...\n\n\nFinally, comparing the lists, which possible new subnet with a /27 mask does not overlap with an existing subnet? Comparing the two lists, the first subnet (172.16.100.0/27) overlaps, but the next one (172.16.100.32/27) does not, making that subnet the correct answer.",

        "explanation": "When a router receives a DHCP address from a DHCP server that has a default gateway configured, it dynamically creates a statically defined default route pointing to the default gateway. The router&rsquo;s WAN interface would be configured with an IP address and subnet mask, while a statically defined default route pointing out the router&rsquo;s WAN interface would be created dynamically.\n\n\tThe gateway in the DHCP lease is not configured as a true default gateway on a router.\n\n\tThe router&rsquo;s LAN interface wouldn&rsquo;t be receiving the DHCP lease information because the router&rsquo;s WAN interface is the port configured as a DHCP client.\n\n\tThe dynamically created static default route would not be pointing out the router&rsquo;s LAN interface because it&rsquo;s the router&rsquo;s WAN interface that is configured as a DHCP client.",

As a result, the DHCP server leases an address from the same subnet as R1&#39;s G0/0/0 interface. \n\nThe figure shows R1&#39;s G0/0/0 IP address and mask. With a little subnetting math, you can derive the following:\n\n\n\tSubnet ID: 10.4.16.0\n\tFirst usable address: 10.4.16.1\n\tLast usable address: 10.4.17.254\n\tSubnet broadcast address: 10.4.17.255\n\n\nThe two correct answers are IP addresses within this range.",

(Choose three answers.)\n\n\nR1# ping web\nType escape sequence to abort.\nSending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 172.25.2.103, timeout is 2 seconds:\n!!!!!\nSuccess rate is 100 percent (5/5), round-trip min/avg/max = 1/1/4 ms",
        "explanation": "First, the output in the exhibit shows that the ping command is working and that the command sends packets to address 172.25.2.103 &ndash; the web server&#39;s address. So, it appears that router R1 resolved the name into the correct IP address.\n\nNext, note that the example shows the ping command from the CLI of router R1 rather than some host. That means the question asks about settings that impact DNS client functions on the router, so the question asks about the router&#39;s configuration. The question also states that the engineer building the lab network wants to use the DNS shown in the lab with domain example.com. Those facts combine to require these configuration settings on the router:\n\n\nip domain lookup\nip name-server 172.25.2.102\nip domain name example.com\n\n\n\nThe commands, in order, enable the following features:\n\n\n\tAct as a DNS client, that is, send DNS name queries\n\tSend DNS requests to one name server at 172.25.2.102.\n\tAppend example.com as the domain name to DNS requests that do not use fully-qualified domain names (FQDNs)\n\n\nAside: In past IOS versions, these commands had slightly different syntax: ip domain-lookup, ip domain-name. The above configuration, without hyphens, shows the more recent and still-current IOS syntax.\n\nAs for the incorrect answers:\n\n\n\tThe ip host command configures a local hostname on the router for hostname web, which is not needed because the router is using DNS.\n\tThe no ip domain lookup command disables the DNS client function on the router, which is the opposite of the intent for this question.\n\tThe ip dns command shown in one answer is not an IOS command.",

        "explanation": "There were three main solutions to the IPv4 address shortage worked on intensely in the 1990s. These were the development of what we now term IPv6, the Network Address Translation process with private IP addresses, and the careful assignment of smaller portions of the public address space to businesses. Subnet broadcast addresses happen to be a useful feature of IP, but has nothing to do with conserving the IPv4 address space.",

The question states that host B is in a different Ethernet VLAN, so it will be in a different IPv6 subnet than host A, with (at least) one router or layer 3 switch between host A&#39;s subnet and host B&#39;s subnet. As a result, host A never needs to learn host B&#39;s MAC address.\n\n\tFor the incorrect answers... ARP is an IPv4 protocol to learn a local device&rsquo;s Layer 2 address and isn&rsquo;t used in IPv6. NDP (Neighbor Discovery Protocol) is used to learn Layer 2 Ethernet addresses when needed, but only functions within the same VLAN. OSPFv3 is a routing protocol used by routers, so it does learn information about other IPv6 subnets - routes to those subnets - but it isn&rsquo;t a protocol to learn the Layer 2 address of a neighbor.",

And it shows the effect of inverting the seventh bit of the MAC address, so the first six hex digits of the MAC address become 020011. Finally, it shows FFFE in the middle of the interface ID.

        "explanation": "SLAAC (Stateless Address Autoconfiguration) uses NDP messages so that hosts learn the IPv6 prefixes on the link from any routers connected to the link. Hosts ask for this information using Router Solicitation (RS) messages, with routers replying with Router Advertisement (RA) messages &ndash; both part of NDP. The RA messages can supply information such as:\n\n\n\tIPv6 prefixes on the link\n\tRouter IPv6 addresses on the link\n\tA list of DNS servers\n\n\nAdditionally, NDP replaces the functions done by ARP in IPv4. It uses Neighbor Solicitation (NS) and Neighbor Advertisement (NA) messages so any IPv6 host can request and learn the MAC address used by other online IPv6 endpoints.\n\nInformation about routes for prefixes not located on the same link requires other tools, like dynamic routing protocols used on routers. Hosts do not usually need a dynamic process to learn specific routes for IPv6 subnets located beyond the local link. Instead, hosts rely on their default router setting as learned from routers via the NDP RA messages",

The host then creates the last 64 bits of the address using EUI-64 rules by splitting its 6-byte MAC address in half and adding hex FFFE (2 bytes) to the middle.

        "explanation": "The RDNSS acronym refers to RA-based DNS Server configuration. Knowing that fact alone should identify one correct and incorrect answer: The host learns the DNS server list from the NDP RA message. RDNSS replaces stateless DHCP for the same purpose, a tool that stores the list of DNS servers on a DHCP server and uses DHCP messages to inform the host.\n\nThe host learns the other settings using typical SLAAC processes. When using SLAAC, the host finds its address prefix from the NDP RA message that one or more routers on the subnet send. The RA identifies the prefixes that exist on the subnet. From that, the host self-assigns a unicast address using that prefix and then chooses an interface ID (IID). Most host operating systems use a randomized process to select the IID rather than using EUI-64.\n\nA SLAAC host learns its default router setting from the router itself. The router sends an NDP RA message which includes the router&#39;s IPv6 address (an LLA) that hosts should use as their default router setting. The host does not need to use any information stored on the DHCP server.",

The host uses calendared addresses for TCP and UDP flows the host initiates. For connections initiated into the host, the host would typically use a permanent address rather than a temporary one (a fact confirming one answer as incorrect.)\n\nThe three address attributes related to the calendared temporary addresses, used for flows initiated by the host, include:\n\nPreferred: Use to initiate all new connections at this time, typically with a single preferred address on an interface at any instant.\n\nValid: Formerly-preferred addresses which can continue to send packets over existing flows. However, the host does not create new flows using a valid address.\n\nDeprecated: Formerly valid addresses that the host no longer uses. No packet flow occurs with addresses with this attribute.\n\nThe facts in the above list confirm the reasoning behind the two correct answers and rule out the remaining incorrect answers.",

        "explanation": "IOS may reject an ipv6 route command when configured. It may accept the command, placing it into the configuration, but only add a route to the IPv6 routing table per that configuration under certain conditions. Sometimes, the route placed into the routing table may not be useful for forwarding IPv6 packets. Working through the commands in the various answers:\n\nThe ipv6 route 2001:db8:1:2::/64 g0/0/1 command: IOS accepts the command, adds it to the configuration, and adds a route to the routing table. However, the route does not function nor attempt to forward packets to R2 as the next-hop router.\n\nThe ipv6 route 2001:db8:1:2::/64 fe80::2 command: IOS rejects the command. IOS logic allows it to recognize the next-hop address as an LLA. IOS also requires an outgoing interface parameter on the command if referring to an LLA as the next-hop address.\n\nThe ipv6 route 2001:db8:1:2::/64 2001:db8:1:12::2 command: IOS accepts the command, placing it in the configuration. IOS places the route in the IPv6 routing table. The route should work because IOS should have a route that matches the next-hop address 2001:db8:1:12::2, as it is an address in the subnet between the two routers. \n\nThe ipv6 route 2001:db8:1:2::/64 g0/0/1 fe80::2 command: IOS accepts the command, placing it in the configuration. IOS places the route in the IPv6 routing table. The command lists the correct outgoing interface (R1&#39;s G0/0/1) and the LLA that router R2 uses on the link between R1 and R2 (fe80::2), so the route should work to forward packets to router R2 next.\n\nThe ipv6 route 2001:db8:1:2::/64 g0/0/0 2001:db8:1:12::2 command: IOS accepts the command, placing it in the configuration. IOS places the route in the IPv6 routing table. However, the route refers to R1&#39;s G0/0/0 as the outgoing interface, which is not the correct interface out which to forward packets for this route. As a result, this route will appear in the routing table but not be useful in forwarding packets.\n\nAs noted in the various explanations, two answers in this scenario result in a working route added to the routing table.",

Which answers list a command that would result in a static route appearing in R1&#39;s IPv6 routing table, but R1 cannot use that route to forward packets successfully? (Choose two answers.)",
        "explanation": "IOS may reject an ipv6 route command when configured. It may accept the command, placing it into the configuration, but only add a route to the IPv6 routing table per that configuration under certain conditions. Sometimes, the route placed into the routing table may not be useful for forwarding IPv6 packets. Working through the commands in the various answers:\n\nThe ipv6 route 2001:db8:1:2::/64 g0/0/1 command: IOS accepts the command, adds it to the configuration, and adds a route to the routing table. However, the route does not function nor attempt to forward packets to R2 as the next-hop router.\n\nThe ipv6 route 2001:db8:1:2::/64 fe80::2 command: IOS rejects the configuration command. IOS logic allows it to recognize the next-hop address as an LLA. IOS also requires an outgoing interface parameter on the command if referring to an LLA as the next-hop address.\n\nThe ipv6 route 2001:db8:1:2::/64 2001:db8:1:12::2 command: IOS accepts the command, placing it in the configuration. IOS places the route in the IPv6 routing table. The route should work because IOS should have a route that matches the next-hop address 2001:db8:1:12::2, as it is an address in the subnet between the two routers. \n\nThe ipv6 route 2001:db8:1:2::/64 g0/0/1 fe80::2 command: IOS accepts the command, placing it in the configuration. IOS places the route in the IPv6 routing table. The command lists the correct outgoing interface (R1&#39;s G0/0/1) and the LLA that router R2 uses on the link between R1 and R2 (fe80::2), so the route should work to forward packets to router R2 next.\n\nThe ipv6 route 2001:db8:1:2::/64 g0/0/0 2001:db8:1:12::2 command: IOS accepts the command, placing it in the configuration. IOS places the route in the IPv6 routing table. However, the route refers to R1&#39;s G0/0/0 as the outgoing interface, which is not the correct interface out which to forward packets for this route. As a result, this route will appear in the routing table but not be useful in forwarding packets.\n\nAs noted in the various explanations, two answers in this scenario result in a non-working route added to the routing table.",

SNMP version 1 was the first release of SNMP, and it did not support Inform and Get-bulk messages. SNMP version 2 was promptly replaced with SNMP version 2c; therefore, it is an invalid answer. SNMP version 3 introduced many new features such as security and encryption, to name a few.",

All switches and routers in the network should be configured to properly prioritize markings of traffic in queues. If it is performed closest to the Internet router, you may not get any effectiveness from the configuration because Internet routers may not process QoS. Not every device in the network needs QoS marking, such as infrastructure services like DHCP and DNS. QoS marking should also not be performed on the core router in the network; a good rule of thumb is don\u2019t implement anything on the core router that could slow it down. The act of QoS marking could slow the core router down; already marked packets are fine.",

        "explanation": "Often a connection to an Internet service provider (ISP) is physically connected with a technology that exceeds the purchased rate. To control the amount of traffic that is allowed onto their network, ISPs limit the rate that traffic is allowed to flow into the network. This is done with traffic policers; to limit the amount of traffic that could potentially be dropped by the ISP&rsquo;s policer, an enterprise could choose to shape the traffic going out of their network and to the ISP.",

        "explanation": "Private IP networks were originally intended for use inside  organizations that had no reason to connect to the Internet or to other  organizations. However, the looming IPv4 address shortage in the early  1990s required some solutions, one of which is NAT/PAT. PAT allows  organizations to use a small number of public IP addresses, assigning  private IP addresses to each individual host, with a device translating  addresses in packets sent to and from the Internet. This allows two  organizations to&nbsp;use the same IP address ranges and still be able to  communicate through the Internet.",

The output below lists all non-default configuration commands for CDP and LLDP. Which answer lists the briefest configuration that would meet the goals if pasting the configuration into global configuration mode? Reject any answers IOS would reject when pasting the commands into configuration mode. \n\n\nlldp run\ninterface G1/0/2\n  no lldp receive",
        "explanation": "You can achieve the stated goal by enabling CDP and LLDP by default while configuring the interface subcommands that disable CDP and LLDP on a particular interface, in this case, G1/0/1.\n\nIOS defaults to use the cdp run and no lldp run global commands, enabling CDP and disabling LLDP globally. That means the interfaces use CDP unless an interface subcommand disables it (no cdp enable.) Conversely, with an LLDP global default of disabled, interfaces do not use LLDP unless an interface subcommand enables it (lldp transmit and lldp receive.)\nHowever, the supplied configuration overrides the LLDP default, enabling LLDP globally with the lldp run global command. With those facts in mind, per the initial configuration, the question begins with the following:\n\n\n\tBoth CDP and LLDP globally enabled\n\tLLDP partially disabled on G1/0/2\n\tCDP is fully functioning, and LLDP is partially functioning on G1/0/2\n\n\nTo disable CDP on the interface, use the no cdp enable interface subcommand, as seen in the correct answer. To disable LLDP on the interface, you need both the no lldp receive and no lldp transmit subcommands. The configuration already includes the first, so the correct answer adds the second of those commands.\n\nTwo incorrect answers list a command IOS will reject: no lldp enable. While IOS uses the no cdp enable interface subcommand to disable CDP on an interface, IOS does not support a no lldp enable interface subcommand. Those answers would not disable LLDP and would also show a command error when pasting the configuration.\n\nFinally, consider the incorrect answer that begins with cdp run but which also has a no lldp transmit command. This answer makes the functions work as intended. However, it requires one additional command compared to the correct answer. The question asked for the briefest configuration that meets the goals, making this answer incorrect.",

Router R1 provides the IP helper feature with the ip helper-address 172.16.2.1 subcommand on its G0/0/0 interface. Which answers list an ACE that, if part of the ACL, would match DHCP messages between the server and clients?",
        "explanation": "The DHCP messages per this question use:\n\n\n\tUDP\n\tSource address 0.0.0.0 (client address before leasing an address)\n\tDestination IP address 255.255.255.255 (destination used by clients because they do not know the DHCP server&rsquo;s address.)\n\tDestination port 67 (bootps)\n\n\nIn this scenario, the ACL inbound on R1&rsquo;s G0/0/0 interface processes the DHCP messages before the IP helper function on R1 changes the IP addresses. As a result, at this point, the router must match the special-purpose source and destination addresses 0.0.0.0 and 255.255.255.255, respectively.\n\nOf the two answers that use the ip protocol keyword, both attempt to match address 172.16.2.1. The DHCP messages do not use that address as the source or destination address, making those answers incorrect.\n\nThe one incorrect ACE referencing the udp protocol keyword attempts to match destination address 172.16.2.1, an address not used in the packet header. That ACE also attempts a match of the wrong destination port (bootpc instead of the correct bootps.) \n\nThe correct answer checks the correct bootps destination port. It also examines the exact source address 0.0.0.0, the correct source address of the packets sent by the DHCP clients.",

        "explanation": "The correct answer has all the ingredients for simple PAT with overloading on an existing outside interface IP address.\n\n\tOf the incorrect choices, one reference R1. If you performed NAT on that router, converting the network 192.168.1.0 addresses to use 10.0.0.1 (as would happen with the R1 configuration), NAT would work, but it would not allow traffic to flow back and forth to the Internet. The NAT solution needs to translate to the public IP address, in this case 23.0.0.2 as shown on R2&#39;s F0/1 interface.\n\n\tFor the two incorrect answers that list R2 as the router: one is incorrect because the&nbsp;NAT inside and outside interfaces are reversed, while the other uses the wrong wildcard mask (255.0.0.0) in the ACL.",

Routers are used to manage traffic and constitute borders between subnets.\nA routing prefix is the sequence of leading bits of an IP address that precede the portion of the address used as host identifier. In IPv4 networks, the routing prefix is often expressed as a \u201csubnet mask\u201d, which is a bit mask covering the number of bits used in the prefix. An IPv4 subnet mask is frequently expressed in quad-dotted decimal representation, e.g., 255.255.255.0 is the subnet mask for the 192.168.1.0 network with a 24-bit routing prefix (192.168.1.0/24).",

These IPv6 addresses are global addresses, these addresses can be assigned to more than one interface unlike an IPv6 unicast address. Anycast is designed to send a packet to the nearest interface that is a part of that anycast group.\nThe sender creates a packet and forwards the packet to the anycast address as the destination address which goes to the nearest router. The nearest router or interface is found by using the metric of a routing protocol currently running on the network. However in a LAN setting the nearest interface is found depending on the order the neighbors were learned. The anycast packet in a LAN setting forwards the packet to the neighbor it learned about first.",

        "explanation": "Several methods are used terms of migration including tunneling, translators, and dual stack. Tunnels are used to carry one protocol inside another, while translators simply translate IPv6 packets into IPv4 packets. Dual stack uses a combination of both native IPv4 and IPv6. With dual stack, devices are able to run IPv4 and IPv6 together and if IPv6 communication is possible that is the preferred protocol. Hosts can simultaneously reach IPv4 and IPv6 content.",

The logging process controls the distribution of logging messages to various destinations, such as the logging buffer (on RAM), terminal lines (console terminal), or a UNIX syslog server, depending on your configuration. The process also sends messages to the console.\nNote: Syslog messages can be written to a file in Flash memory although it is not a popular place to use.
