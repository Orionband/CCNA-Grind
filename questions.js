        "questionText":  "What option(s) are required criteria for a service to be a cloud service?",
        "explanation":  "Five specific criteria are required for a service to be a cloud service:\n\n\t\n\t\tOn-demand self-service: You determine when you want and do not want a service.\n\t\n\t\tBroad network access: The cloud service must be accessible by numerous connectivity options and a fast number of devices should be able to leverage it.\n\t\n\t\tResource pooling: Instead of assigning dedicated resources, such as memory and CPU, to each system, resources can be shared across a set of services, servers, and systems. These shared resources are then dynamically allocated on-demand as a system needs it.\n\t\n\t\tRapid elasticity: A cloud service is very different from an on-premise virtual environment. There are still capabilities like resource pooling on-premise, but with rapid elasticity it\u0026rsquo;s hard to come by. Rapid elasticity makes the pools of resources seem unlimited. New resource requests are completed rapidly.\n\t\n\t\tMeasured service: In a cloud service, utilization is tracked and monitored, which can then be reported on by the operator. This is used for billing but also can be used for other capabilities if needed by an organization.\n\n\n\tBoth agile network access and proactive service are unrelated to a cloud service offering and refer to business architecture principals.",

A public cloud, on the other hand, is a service that is owned and operated by a third party, but with the people that request and use the service being employees of a number of different companies that choose to use the service.",

Which answers accurately compare and contrast VMs and containers? (Choose two answers.)",
        "explanation":  "Virtual Machines (VMs) rely on a virtualization system with a hypervisor. The VM includes an installed OS, so starting a VLM includes initializing (booting) the OS. That process relies on the usual computer components: CPU, RAM, disk, and network. The hypervisor virtualizes those computer resources so the VM can be initialized and run.\n\nA container image does not include an OS and does not rely on a virtualization system or hypervisor. Instead, it depends on an OS with container support and a container engine. The container image includes all software components needed to run an application besides the OS. The container engine enables the management of starting and stopping containers.\n\nAs for the answers, VMs use a hypervisor, while containers do not, instead using a container engine. Also, initializing a VM includes booting an OS, so starting a VM may take several minutes. Starting a container takes seconds, more like the time taken to start an application.",

        "explanation":  "\u0026nbsp;\n\nWith legacy ACLs and how we as an industry have managed them over the years, there are a lot of inherent management nightmares. For example, ACEs could not be removed because of the potential risk of failure to the entire ACL. New changes add to the current ACL, which ends up being more complicated the longer it gets.\n\nCisco SD-Access instead uses group-based security with SGTs. Instead of hard coding a security rule in a list like an ACL, you can identify who and what something is, assign a value to it, and then look up that value in a grid or matrix to validate what the user should and shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be doing. With this new model, there are some huge benefits:\n\n\n\tEach new security requirement can be considered separately from the existing policies.\n\tCisco SD-Access (through Cisco Catalyst Center) keeps the security policies clear as a grid of security groups and their allowed access\n\tAs a result, each policy can be removed without affecting another policy.\n\tThe user interface includes note-taking space to\u0026nbsp;track why a policy was created.\n\tThere is proper logging of when the policy is being used and by whom, and when the policy was last used.\n\n\nFor the incorrect answers, first, note that the user interface in Cisco Catalyst Center shows the SGT access policies as a grid, rather than showing the matching logic as compiled into an integrated whole, making it much easier to work with the policies. You can add new SGTs, and set their access rights (permit, deny), without considering any changes to the existing parts of the table.",

        "explanation":  "In a Cisco SD-Access fabric, the underlay IP addressing scheme uses a separate IP address space as compared to endpoint devices and the overlay network. The endpoint addresses (like PC1 and PC2 in this question) use addresses from the same address space as the overlay tunnels (address range 192.168.0.0/16 in this question.) The underlay uses addresses from the range 172.16.0.0/12. Also, switches SW2 and SW3, which do not sit at the edge of the network (and are therefore not Fabric Edge or Fabric Border nodes), do not participate in the overlay at all. So, of the four answers, only the correct answer shows all four addresses from the underlay range 172.16.0.0/12. Of the incorrect answers, some list addresses from the overlay address space that would be useful on edge/border nodes SW1 and SW4, but those answers also overlay addresses for switches SW2 and SW3, which do not need addresses in the overlay address space at all.",

A client computer or device would make a RESTful API call to the application.\n\t\n\t\tLayered system: With REST APIs, you can leverage the single URI to complete any task at hand.

        "questionText":  "From the following options, what are the required REST API attributes?",
        "explanation":  "There are six required attributes for REST APIs:\n\n\t\n\t\tClient/server architecture: REST APIs operate in the client/server model. This means that an application is built with RESTful APIs that act as the server. A client computer or device would make a RESTful API call to the application.\n\t\n\t\tStateless operation: All of the state for the connections between client and server is actually on the client. The servers do not hold any state for that connection. This is good because it puts less load on the servers so they can process more requests. From a client perspective, the client must be sure to send the necessary information that the server will need to complete the request.\n\t\n\t\tClear determination of whether a resource can be cached: With REST APIs, servers can cache the most used resources. This is usually used with GET requests. Caching can speed up the operations and the responses to the users.\n\t\n\t\tUniform interface: In the RESTful world, everything is perceived to be a resource, no matter whether it\u0026rsquo;s a document, function, method, class, or module. This simple uniformity of interface leads to consistency and rapid deployment of new systems.\n\t\n\t\tLayered system: With REST APIs, you can leverage the single URI to complete any task at hand. In the background you have no idea that the URI you used actually ended up utilizing several servers/services in the back end.\n\t\n\t\tCode on demand: With REST APIs, you can determine what form of data you want back, and not just the values of data. If you want the form of data to be JSON, XML, or YAML, you can specify that. This is still all with a single URI because it\u0026rsquo;s just a value in the header of the request.\n\n\n\tFor the incorrect options, REST APIs do not run in a peer-to-peer architecture and do not leverage a dynamic interface.",

Configuration mirroring is a method of duplicating or replicating existing configurations. Configuration monitoring is the act of looking at the configuration over time to see whether there are any changes or deviations (drift).

Configuration drift is when changes are made to a device or multiple devices that are not the intended configurations.\n\n\tThis is not version control. Version control is tracking the different changes that have occurred in a repository or system and creating version numbers for each change. This enables you as an operator to restore a past configuration version if the need arises.\n\n\tCentralized configuration is a process of moving the configurations to a central server or service. The key with this process is to make sure future changes to configurations are actually completed on the central server and not on the individual devices themselves.\n\n\tConfiguration monitoring is an alert that the configuration of a device is different than the intended configuration.

The key with this process is to make sure future changes to configurations are actually completed on the central server and not on the individual devices themselves.\n\n\tVersion control is tracking the different changes that have occurred in a repository or system and creating version numbers for each change. This enables you as an operator to restore a past configuration version if the need arises.\n\n\tConfiguration drift is when changes are made to a device or multiple devices that are not the intended configurations.",

An API can be considered  RESTful  if it has the following features:\n* Client/server   The client handles the front end and the server handles the back end.\n* Stateless   No client data is stored on the server between requests. The session state is stored on the client.\n* Cacheable   Clients can cache responses locally to improve performance.",

This command can be useful in isolated environments where an external NTP server isn t available. It can also function as a backup; if the device loses connectivity to its NTP servers, it can still function as an NTP server and provide the time to its own clients.",

Spine-leaf topologies provide high-bandwidth, low-latency, non-blocking server-to-server connectivity. Leaf (aggregation) switches are what provide devices access to the fabric (the network of spine and leaf switches) and are typically deployed at the top of the rack. Generally, devices connect to the leaf switches. Devices can include servers, Layer 4-7 services (firewalls and load balancers), and WAN or Internet routers. Leaf switches do not connect to other leaf switches. In spine-and-leaf architecture, every leaf should connect to every spine in a full mesh. Spine (aggregation) switches are used to connect to all leaf switches and are typically deployed at the end or middle of the row. Spine switches do not connect to other spine switches.",

        "explanation":  "Separating the control plane from the data plane is a fundamental principle of Software-Defined Networking (SDN).\n\n- **Control Plane:** Responsible for network intelligence, decision-making (e.g., routing tables, forwarding policies).\n- **Data Plane (or Forwarding Plane):** Responsible for the actual forwarding of packets based on instructions from the control plane.\n\nIn SDN, the control plane is *decoupled* from individual network devices and **centralized in an SDN controller**.\n\n- The primary benefit of this separation is **centralized decision-making, enabling more efficient and scalable network management** (Option B).\n- This allows for a global view of the network, simplifies policy enforcement, enables automation, and enhances network agility.\n\n- It does not necessarily lead to faster packet forwarding by combining functions on a single chip (Option A often refers to traditional integrated designs).\n- It doesn\u0027t primarily reduce the number of interfaces (Option C) or improve physical security (Option D).",

        "explanation":  "In Software-Defined Networking (SDN) architectures, the network is often conceptualized in two main layers:\n\n- **Underlay Network:** The physical infrastructure (routers, switches, cables) that provides the basic, physical connectivity.\n- **Overlay Network:** The **virtual network layer built on top of the physical underlay**. It provides logical segmentation and abstraction, allowing virtual networks to be created and managed independently of the physical hardware. This separation enables flexibility, rapid provisioning, and centralized control.",

E-Line is used to connect two devices that can exchange Ethernet frames similarly to a point-to-point link. E-LAN acts similarly to a local LAN (full mesh) and allows all devices to directly connect to each other. E-Tree resembles a hub-and-spoke topology and allows a \u0026ldquo;hub\u0026rdquo; device to communicate with all \u0026ldquo;spoke\u0026rdquo; devices, but the \u0026ldquo;spokes\u0026rdquo; are not able to directly communicate without being relayed through the \u0026ldquo;hub.\u0026rdquo;",

        "explanation":  "Devices that perform routing - routers and multilayer switches - use virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) instances to create multiple instances of a router within one device. Without VRFs, a router has a single routing table, and the router places all IP routes into one IP routing table. With VRFs, the router creates a routing table for each VRF. Additional configuration can place interfaces into the VRFs so that their connected routes land in the associated per-VRF routing table. The routing protocol configuration can also place routing protocol neighbor relationships into the different VRFs, so routes learned via those neighbors again land in the correct per-VRF routing table.\n\nA router without VRFs has a single IP routing table. Once configured to use VRFs, the router has the original IP routing table (the global routing table) plus one IP routing table per VRF. Interfaces and routing protocol neighbors not placed into a VRF feed their routes into the global routing table.\n\nIn this question, with two VRFs, the router has three IP routing tables: one per VRF plus the global routing table.",

        "questionText":  "All routers and interfaces in the figure work. The text below shows the only current IP route for subnet 172.16.30.192/26 in router R1. At that point, an engineer configures the command ip route 172.16.30.192 255.255.255.192 172.16.13.3 120 on router R1. Which answer describes how router R1 processes the command?\n\n\nR1# show ip route\n! Lines omitted for brevity\n      172.16.0.0/16 is variably subnetted, 4 subnets, 2 masks\nO        172.16.30.192/26 [110/3] via 172.16.12.2, 00:04:56, GigabitEthernet0/0/1",
        "explanation":  "This question revolves around the administrative distance of the existing route and the route defined in the ip route command as a classic example of a floating static route. Per the output in the exhibit, the existing route has an administrative distance of 110. The route also has a code that means it is an OSPF interarea route, and OSPF uses a default administrative distance of 110. So the route appears to have been learned by OSPF. The ip route command in the question ends with 120, which is the administrative distance applied to the route in the command.\n\nAdditionally, note that the existing route defines a route to subnet 172.16.30.192, mask /26. The /26 mask is equivalent to mask 255.255.255.192, the mask used in the ip route command. So both the existing route and the route in the ip route command refer to the same subnet.\n\nIOS accepts the configuration command, adding it to the running-config file, because there are no syntax or value errors in the command. Because the command uses a higher administrative distance, IOS does not add a route to the routing table. If the router ever loses the OSPF route to that subnet, IOS would add a route based on this configured static route.",

        "explanation":  "To accept the command into the configuration, it must have correct syntax. Also, the two numeric parameters must pass a test in which the first number is a subnet ID when using the configured mask, rather than being an address or a subnet broadcast address. IOS would reject the command if the first numeric value was not a subnet ID. In this case, the command fails the value test, confirming the one correct answer. The math:\n\n\n\tConfigured \u0026ldquo;subnet\u0026rdquo; 172.16.2.160\n\tConfigured mask 255.255.255.192 (correct)\n\tSubnetting math reveals: Subnet ID 172.16.2.128, subnet broadcast address 172.16.2.191, range of valid addresses 172.16.2.129 \u0026ndash; 190.\n\n\nAs a result, the router would reject the configuration command and not add it to the configuration file.\n\nThe key to the rest of the answers can be easily ruled out because IOS will not attempt to add a route if it already rejected the ip route command.",

The design uses OSPF over the Ethernet WAN link. What command enables you to configure a floating static route on the branch router to the 200.200.200.0/24 network should the primary link fail?",
        "explanation":  "A floating static route is a method that is used to add a static route to the routing table should an existing better route disappear. This usually happens when the main routing protocol that is used is cut off from a spoke/branch. When the device sees that the routing protocol route has been removed from the routing table, it inserts the static route (thus the floating). In this case, the 200.200.200.0/24 network exists off of the central router. To back it up, a route must be added that points the routing for this prefix through the central backup router. (A similar action is done at the central location, as well, to ensure that a return route exists).\n\n\tNote that the administrative distance of the floating static route in this case needed to be a higher number than 110, the default administrative distance used by OSPF. Of the three incorrect answers, Two give an administrative distance less than 110, so that the static route would be in the routing table even when OSPF was learning a route for the same subnet. Also, two of the incorrect answers point to the wrong next-hop router (50.50.50.1 and 100.100.100.2), so they would not be used.",

An engineer configures the command ip route 10.4.64.0 255.255.254.0 10.4.12.2 command on router R1, and the router adds the command to its running-config file. However, a static route does not appear in router R1\u0026rsquo;s routing table. Which answers give a reason why R1 would not add the static route to the table?",
        "explanation":  "For the correct answer, only a few reasons exist that result in the router accepting the command into the configuration while also not adding a route to the routing table. To accept the command into the configuration, it must have correct syntax. Also, the two numeric parameters must pass a test in which the first number is a subnet ID when using the configured mask, rather than being an address or a subnet broadcast address. IOS would reject the command if the first numeric value was not a subnet ID.\n\nOnce in the configuration, IOS would not add the route to the routing table if:\n\n\n\tA better route (with a lower administrative distance) already exists in the routing table\n\tThe static route\u0026rsquo;s next-hop address (if configured) is not reachable by the router.\n\tThe static route\u0026rsquo;s outgoing interface (if configured) is not in an up/up state.\n\n\nOnly one of those reasons appears in the answers and is the correct answer in this case. R1 would not have a connected route matching next-hop address 10.4.12.2 if the link between the routers were down, for instance.\n\nFor the incorrect answer that mentions the lack of an administrative distance parameter, that parameter is optional, defaulting to 1, and the command is fine without that parameter.\n\nFor the answer claiming that the first numeric parameter is not a subnet ID, it is incorrect. You can do the math on the values in the ip route command to confirm that fact. However, the question tells you the router accepted the command and added it to the configuration, which confirms that the router thinks the values are acceptable.\n\nFinally, one answer claims that the subnet listed by the command is not the subnet connected to router R2. That claim is not true; it is the subnet listed off R2 in the figure. However, even if the ip route command referred to a non-existent subnet, it would still add the route to the routing table.

        "explanation":  "First, connect the term SVI to the term \u0026quot;VLAN interface\u0026quot; and look for any VLAN interfaces. The show ip interface brief command lists interface VLAN100 at the end of the output. VLAN100 is a Switched Virtual Interface, or SVI - another name for a VLAN interface. Per that output, SVI (VLAN interface 100) is in a down/down state.\n\n\tSeveral issues can cause a switch to list a VLAN interface in a down/down state. Or stated positively, the following must be true for an SVI to be in an up/up state:\n\n\t\n\t\tThe corresponding VLAN must exist on the switch\n\t\n\t\tThe corresponding VLAN (VLAN 100 in this case) must be active (that is, not shutdown)\n\t\n\t\tAt least one access interface must be configured to be in the corresponding VLAN, OR... a operational trunk interface exists and the VLAN is included in the trunk\u0026#39;s allowed list\n\t\n\t\tThe SVI (the VLAN interface) must be enabled, that is, not shutdown\n\n\n\tIf any of the first three conditions are not true, the SVI lands in a down/down state. If the SVI is shutdown, the switch places the SCI into an administratively down state.\u0026nbsp;\n\n\tFor this scenario, the exhibit shows that VLAN 100, per the show vlan brief command, is in an act/lshut state, meaning that the VLAN (not the VLAN interface, but the VLAN) has been shutdown. As a result, the switch places the matching VLAN interface into a down/down state.",

        "explanation":  "First, the terminology can get in the way when discussing VLANs and VLAN interfaces. A VLAN includes all devices in the same broadcast domain. The configuration defines the VLAN with the vlan vlan-id global command. Access ports have an assigned access VLAN, while trunk ports support many VLANs. The term VLAN interface refers to a switch\u0026#39;s layer 3 interface that connects to the VLAN, on which the switch configuration can include an IP address. The configuration creates such an interface with the interface vlan vlan-id global command.\n\nThe question asks about the state of two VLAN interfaces, with the question text ending by noting that both VLAN interfaces use the autostate setting (the default.) As a result, the interfaces require several states to be good for the VLAN interface to be up/up, including:\n\n\n\tAt least one working physical interface in that VLAN, including access VLANs and trunks that include the VLAN in the allowed VLAN list.\n\tThe VLAN (not the VLAN interface, but the VLAN) must be defined and active (that is, not shutdown).\n\tThe VLAN interface must not be shutdown.\n\n\nThe question tells us that both VLAN interfaces are initially in an up/up state, so at that point, all these criteria must be true. For the VLAN 11 interface, the new configuration disables one physical link (G1/0/2), but interface G1/0/1, also in VLAN 11 per the exhibit, remains active. So that action does not cause interface VLAN 11 to fail.\n\nThe second new configuration item disables VLAN 12 with the shutdown command. As a result, IOS disables the associated VLAN 12 interface. So, the correct answer notes that interface VLAN 11 remains up, but that interface VLAN 12 fails.",

That configuration includes layer 2 settings on the physical interfaces, for instance, setting a VLAN ID with the switchport access vlan vlan-id interface subcommand. To configure IP settings, you configure a VLAN interface for each VLAN used on those embedded switch ports. \n\nTo create the VLAN interface, use the interface vlan vlan-id command. That command moves the CLI into VLAN interface config mode, where you can configure the ip address command to configure the router\u0026#39;s IP address on that interface. The PCs in that VLAN will use that address as their default router setting.\n\nThe above facts detail why the correct answer is correct.

        "explanation":  "There are a few problems that exist in this potential configuration.\n\nFirst, the encapsulation dot1q command is not allowed under the physical interface, but it is shown in the configuration. That command is used only under ROAS subinterfaces.\n\nSecond, the native VLAN should be configured to be processed by one special subinterface or by the physical interface, but not both. To process the native VLAN with the physical interface, you would simply give the physical interface an IP address, as is shown here. However, the encapsulation dot1q 30 native subcommnand tells the router to process the native VLAN\u0026#39;s traffic on the matching subinterface. A correct configuration should do one or the other, but not both.\n\nFinally, the VLAN assignment commands (encapsulation dot1q) that are configured on subinterfaces Gi0/0.200 and Gi0/0.300 are reversed; this would cause traffic to be handled by the wrong subinterfaces in comparison to the figure. It is also important to note that the subinterface numbers that are used do not affect VLAN assignments; they are separate. While it is considered best practice to use numbers that are easy to reference, it is not required.",

        "explanation":  "Over their long history, most router interfaces behaved like router interfaces. However, eventually, Cisco began offering router hardware that integrated router and switch features. Over time, Cisco added small sets of LAN switch ports for some router models. In Cisco\u0026#39;s implementation of these interfaces, Cisco refers to interfaces that behave like traditional router interfaces as routed interfaces or routed ports, and the interfaces that act like LAN-switched ports are called switched interfaces or switched ports.\n\nIdentifying the routed and switched ports can be challenging. On Cisco routers, the interface cannot change from one to the other once you order and receive the router. Instead, you can order Cisco routers, and depending on the model, they may have only routed interfaces, or they may also include some switched interfaces. \n\nYou can identify the type of port from the configuration: routed ports support the ip address subcommand (while switch ports do not, and switched ports support only layer 2 configuration commands, like the switchport access vlan command, while routed ports do not. Based on these facts, the ip address command under interface G0/0/0 confirms the interface is a routed port, and the presence of the switchport access vlan command under interface G0/1/4 confirms it is a switched port.\n\nAs a result, When using a router with LAN switch ports, the router configuration mimics the configuration in a layer 3 switch. That configuration includes layer 2 settings on the physical interfaces, for instance, setting a VLAN ID with the switchport access vlan vlan-id interface subcommand. To configure IP settings, you configure a VLAN interface for each VLAN used on those embedded switch ports. \n\nTo create the VLAN interface, use the interface vlan vlan-id command. That command moves the CLI into VLAN interface config mode, where you can configure the ip address command to configure the router\u0026#39;s IP address on that interface. The PCs in that VLAN will use that address as their default router setting.",

An SVI is often used to configure an IP address on a switch to allow remote management, but the question asks why a switch would need multiple SVIs, and to support remote management, a single SVI is needed.\u0026nbsp;\n\n\t\u0026nbsp;",

        "explanation":  "When Router-on-a-Stick (ROAS) is configured on a router, the encapsulation command is used on a router\u0026rsquo;s Ethernet subinterface to associate it with a specific VLAN. The addition of the native keyword at the end will treat the specific VLAN as native for the interface and all the subinterfaces. This means that all frames that are received without an IEEE 802.1q tag will be routed to this interface (or subinterface). In this case, to associate a subinterface with the VLAN 200 and enable it to handle untagged frames, use the encapsulation dot1q 200 native command, which would be used while in subinterface configuration mode. It is important to be aware that by configuring this interface as native, all untagged frames that are received will be considered and processed as VLAN 200 traffic.",

The routers will both send Hellos, check parameters, and if the parameters match, list the neighbor\u0026#39;s RID in subsequent Hellos. At that point, both reach a 2-way state and are ready to exchange their LSDBs.\n\n\tNote that OSPF does not use ping as any part of establishing a neighbor relationship. Also, note that if the routers had begun to exchange their LSDBs, they would have reached other OSPF neighbor states.",

The OSPF **network** command can use any wildcard mask that works. The command\u0026rsquo;s goal is to match interfaces, and once matched, IOS enables OSPF on the matched interfaces and assigns them to the area as noted in the command. So, you can invert the subnet mask to come up with a wildcard mask to use in the network command. But you can use any other wildcard mask as well. Then IOS determines the range of addresses as computed from the address and wildcard mask in the network command, compares that range to all interfaces on the router, and for those matched, enables OSPF. So, you asked \u0026ldquo;Shouldn\u0026rsquo;t\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; - there\u0026rsquo;s no should or shouldn\u0026rsquo;t, just what is, and then the job is to figure out which interfaces are matched by which network commands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\tNow, if I were configuring OSPF in a real network, would I pick a convention, and use it on all routers? Yes. Might I invert the subnet mask like you did as the convention? Perfectly reasonable. But for the exams, you should know how to interpret the range of addresses etc as per above.\u0026quot;, 10/21 - query to Au, OK-as-is, 8/22 - query to Au, CD-I2-4-52-005-1\u003c/p\u003e\n",

        "questionText":  "Her boss asks a junior engineer to suggest a single OSPF network command to use on router R1 in the figure. The goal: match all three interfaces with the one network command. The command must also follow all command conventions so that IOS will not change the command when the engineer adds it to the configuration. Which answer meets all the requirements?",
        "explanation":  "The question requires that the command not be changed by IOS when added to the router configuration. In some cases, IOS will change the subnet value (the first value) in the OSPF network command when you add it to the configuration. By convention, the first numeric value must be the numerically lowest number in the range defined by the combined subnet plus wildcard fields. If not, IOS changes your value to the lowest number in the range. \n\nFor instance, in this case, the network 172.16.30.1 0.0.0.255 area 0 command defines a range with the idea of \u0026quot;all addresses that begin 172.16.30\u0026quot;. Numerically, the range is 172.16.30.0 \u0026ndash; 172.16.30.255. However, with an initial value of 172.16.30.1, which is not the number at the low end of the range, IOS would change the command to network 172.16.30.0 0.0.0.255 area 0.\n\nTwo incorrect answers have values in the subnet field that would result in IOS changing the command, making them incorrect based on the wording of this question:\n\nnetwork 172.16.30.1 0.0.0.255\u0026hellip; becomes network 172.16.30.0 0.0.0.255\u0026hellip;\n\nnetwork 172.16.30.1 0.0.1.255\u0026hellip; becomes network 172.16.30.0 0.0.1.255\u0026hellip;\n\nFor the two remaining answers, one creates an address range that includes all three interfaces, and one matches only two interfaces, not matching interface G0/0/0\u0026#39;s IP address. You can easily find the range of values matched by the network command. Once in the configuration file, the command has the number at the low end of the range as the first value. You simply add the two values (subnet and wildcard mask) to find the high end of the range. In this case:\n\nnetwork 172.16.30.0 0.0.0.255\u0026hellip; has a range of: 172.16.30.0 \u0026ndash; 172.16.30.255\n\nnetwork 172.16.30.0 0.0.1.255\u0026hellip; has a range of: 172.16.30.0 \u0026ndash; 172.16.31.255\n\nBased on comparing those ranges to the interface addresses, only the network 172.16.30.0 0.0.1.255\u0026hellip; command matches all three interfaces.",

The output includes a heading line like this for interfaces in each area, so with only one such heading line, this router only assigns interfaces to area 0 with this command.

The correct answer, ip ospf 1 area 0, lists them in the correct location.\n\nRegarding OSPF neighbors, using the show ip ospf neighbor command works much better. Still, this command at least identifies the OSPF RID of all neighbors under the heading \u0026quot;Routing Information Sources.\u0026quot; In this case, R1 has neighbor relationships with three other routers, with RIDs 2.2.2.2, 3.3.3.3, and 4.4.4.4.\n\n\u0026nbsp;\n\n\u0026nbsp;",

        "questionText":  "Four OSPF routers connect to the same LAN. In a new election after all routers have been rebooted, which router wins the DR election?",
        "explanation":  "First, the DR election always chooses the BDR to become the DR if a BDR exists. However, the question states that all the routers just rebooted, so there should be no BDR to take over for the DR. As worded, the question creates a scenario where all routers compete equally to become DR.\n\n\tThe routers choose the router with the highest OSPF interface priority, and if a tie, they then use the router with the highest router ID. In this case, the answers show routers with different priorities, so no ties exist based on priority. As a result, R1, with the highest priority (4), becomes the DR.",

        "explanation":  "The\u0026nbsp;default-information originate\u0026nbsp;command advertises a default route throughout the OSPF domain. A working default route must exist on the router with the\u0026nbsp;default-information originate\u0026nbsp;command for the command to work correctly. R3 meets this requirement using a default static route to 192.0.2.1, an address located off R3\u0026#39;s G0/1 interface. R3 then advertises a default route into the OSPF domain as an external route. As OSPF propagates the route from router to router, each router alters the next-hop to reflect the next upstream router\u0026#39;s address. For instance, R3 would advertise a default route with a next-hop of 10.10.10.1, and R2 would advertise it with a next-hop of 20.20.20.1. As a result, the default route on router R1 will list 20.20.20.1 as its next-hop address.",

        "explanation":  "\u0026nbsp;\n\n\tYou can influence the DR/BDR election by changing the OSPF interface priority and the OSPF Router ID.\u0026nbsp; The highest interface priority value wins during an election. Those\u0026nbsp; values range from 0 to 255. The sequence works like this:\n\n\t\n\t\tDuring an election, the routers choose the router with the highest interface priority.\n\t\n\t\tIf the interface priority ties, the election chooses the router with the highest OSPF RID.\n\n\n\tThe other two settings mentioned in the answers, the reference bandwidth, and the OSPF process ID, have no impact on the DR/BDR election.\n\n\t\u0026nbsp;",

        "explanation":  "OSPF routers elect the DR and BDR based on the highest RID among the routers actively negotiating on the specific link. Initially, R2, R3, and R4 compete with their RIDs of 10.1.1.2, 10.1.1.3, and 10.1.1.4, respectively, based on each router\u0026#39;s numerically-highest OSPF Router IDs. With the configuration shown, the routers all use the IP addresses on their loopback interfaces as router ID. (Note that none of the routers configured their RIDs directly.) As a result of R4 having the numerically-highest RID, R4 becomes DR. R3, with the next highest RID, becomes the BDR.\n\n\tNote that the addition of a new router to the LAN (R1) does not cause the routers to elect a new DR or BDR. Only the failure of a DR or BDR on the LAN causes a new election.",

All routers on the same link/subnet must be in the same OSPF area, and one answer describes configuration that places the ends of the link in different areas.

Both require that you recall some default settings. First, R1 uses 9 for priority, and R2 defaults to use 1. The numbers can be the same or different; the priority values only cause a failure if you set both to 0. The answer with the ip ospf dead-interval 40 interface subcommand sets the configuration value to the same value as the default setting on the other router, so that does not cause a problem.\n\nFinally, one incorrect answer is incorrect because, although it does cause a problem, R1 does display R2\u0026#39;s RID in the neighbor table.

        "explanation":  "With all default settings, the OSPF interface costs of all the Gigabit interfaces default to cost 1. The cost from R1 to subnet 172.16.30.192/26 is 2 over both routes (through R2 and R3.) R1 also has a default OSPF subcommand setting of maximum-paths 4, or at least a default with a value of more than 1.\n\nCombining these facts, R1 will calculate two routes for the subnet, find both OSPF routes have an equal metric, and due to the maximum-paths setting, it will add both routes to the routing table. Both will be stable and remain in the table. By default, the router will load balance traffic across the two routes on a destination-by-destination basis.",

        "questionText":  "All links in the figure work with valid IP addresses. The two configuration lines below exist on all three routers, with no other non-default OSPF settings on any of the three routers. As a result, R1 lists two neighbor relationships. An engineer considers adding the commands described in the answers to router R1\u0026#39;s configuration. Which answers would result in a failure of at least one OSPF neighbor relationship?\n\n\nrouter ospf 1\n  network 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 area 0",
        "explanation":  "The configuration enables OSPF on all interfaces and assigns them to area 0 per the configured network command. Also, as worded, all routers will use the default values for all other OSPF settings. For each answer, you need to decide if the configuration change would impact R1\u0026#39;s neighbor relationship with either R2 or R3, with the correct answers being those that cause a problem. Working through the correct answers:\n\n\n\tThe answer that changes R1\u0026#39;s G0/0/1 Hello interval to 11, instead of the default used by neighbor R2 of 10, causes the existing neighbor relationship to fail. Neighbors must use the same Hello and Dead intervals. \n\tThe answer with the ip ospf shutdown interface subcommand on R1\u0026#39;s G0/0/1 interface disables all OSPF processing. As a result, R1\u0026#39;s neighbor relationship with R2 fails.\n\tThe answer that describes an inbound ACL on router R1\u0026#39;s G0/0/2 interface, which filters all OSPF Hello messages, causes the neighbor relationships on that interface to fail. OSPF uses the continual receipt of Hello messages to indicate that the neighbor is still up and working.\n\n\nAs for the incorrect answers \u0026ndash; those that do not cause a problem:\n\n\n\tAll the routers use Ethernet-type interfaces, which use a default broadcast network type. The ip ospf network broadcast command just reconfigures the default setting and does not make a change.\n\tThe answer with the ip ospf shutdown interface subcommand on R1\u0026#39;s G0/0/0 interface disables all OSPF processing. However, R1 has no OSPF neighbors off that interface, so the configuration change does not result in any neighbor failures, making this answer incorrect for this question.",

Next, the network commands on the two routers do not have to match in any way at all; the only requirement is that both routers have OSPF enabled on the interfaces somehow. Finally, OSPF uses interface IP addresses and multicast addresses as the source and destination of OSPF packets, often which do not happen to be the OSPF RID, so an ACL that matches the RID would not necessarily stop OSPF from working.",

The WAN link works, and a ping of the IP address on the opposite end of the link works from each router. Which answer best describes the output you expect to find in this case? (Choose two answers.)\n\n\nOn R1: \ninterface GigabitEthernet0/0/1\n  ip address 10.1.12.1 255.255.255.0\n  ip ospf 1 area 0\n\nOn R2: \ninterface GigabitEthernet0/0/0\n  ip address 10.1.12.2 255.255.255.0\n  ip ospf 1 area 0\n  ip mtu 1600",

Combining the default setting on R1\u0026#39;s G0/0/1 with the configuration on R2\u0026#39;s G0/0/0 MTU of 1600 creates an MTU mismatch. With OSPF, the routers attempt to become neighbors, listing each other for a time in the output of the show ip ospf neighbor command. However, the neighbor relationship fails due to the MTU mismatch, so the routers remove the neighbor table entry. The routers repeat this process over and over.\n\nThe routers fail to exchange any LSAs, so they add no routes. So, R2 will not list a route for subnet 10.1.1.0/24, and R1 will not list a route for subnet 10.1.2.0/24.",

The Subnet IDs and masks are:\n\n\u0026bull;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;10.1.1.0/24 (R1 G0/0/0)\n\u0026bull;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;10.1.12.0/30 (R1-R2 link)\n\u0026bull;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;10.1.13.0/30 (R1-R3 link)\n\u0026bull;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;10.1.14.0/30 (R1-R4 link)\n\u0026bull;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;10.1.2.0/24 (R2)\n\u0026bull;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;10.1.3.0/24 (R3)\n\u0026bull;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;10.1.4.0/24 (R4)\n\nFor the three subnets on the right, router R1 will learn routes using OSPF. With a single area, those routes appear in R1\u0026#39;s routing table with code O, as noted with the correct answer that lists subnet 10.1.3.0/24. A different (incorrect) answer lists code O for subnet 10.1.12.0/30. That subnet connects to one of router R1\u0026#39;s interfaces, so it would not be an OSPF-learned route, but rather a connected route on router R1 (with code C.)\u0026nbsp;\n\nFor router R1\u0026#39;s four interfaces, the router will list a connected route for each subnet, each with code C. Those facts confirm the correct answer that shows code C with subnet 10.1.1.0/24.\u0026nbsp;\n\nFinally, a router adds a local route (code L) for the specific interface address, with prefix length /32, for each working interface. None of the correct answers lists code L with a /32 prefix length.\n\nThe incorrect answer that lists code D is incorrect because D refers to EIGRP-learned routes, and the network does not use EIGRP.",

In summary, the router will add routes to all four subnets, a fact that rules out as incorrect the one answer that claims a subnet does not appear in the routing table.\n\nOf the four answers that mention a subnet and a legend code, two refer to a subnet and the correct routing protocol code (O for OSPF for the route to subnet 10.9.2.0/23 and S for static for the route to subnet 10.9.1.0/24.)

Some misconfigurations and operational status values would prevent R1 from listing R2\u0026#39;s OSPF router ID in the show ip ospf command output.\u0026nbsp; Which answers list such a configuration or status? (Choose two answers.)",
        "explanation":  "Some misconfiguration and status issues do not cause a problem for OSPF neighbors. Others cause a problem so that a router does not list the potential neighbor as a neighbor in the output of the show ip ospf neighbor command. Some other problems prevent the neighbor relationship from working correctly, but the neighbor appears in the command output. This question reviews some of the reasons for each category.\n\nThe correct answers identify configuration or status that confirms that R1 and R2 will not have an OSPF neighbor relationship and that router R1 does not list R2\u0026#39;s RID in the list of neighbors. All routers on the same link/subnet must be in the same OSPF area, and one answer describes configuration that places the ends of the link in different areas. The other correct answer describes an allowed case of both routers using OSPF Process ID 1, but a disallowed case of both routers using the same router ID (1.1.1.1.) \n\nFor the incorrect answers, two refer to conditions that do not result in any problem at all. Both require that you recall some default settings. First, R1 uses 9 for priority, and R2 defaults to use 1. The numbers can be the same or different; the priority values only cause a failure if you set both to 0. The answer with the ip ospf dead-interval 40 interface subcommand sets the configuration value to the same value as the default setting on the other router, so that does not cause a problem.\n\nFinally, one incorrect answer is incorrect because, although it does cause a problem, R1 does display R2\u0026#39;s RID in the neighbor table. In that case, the two routers become neighbors and exchange LSAs, but they cannot build routes based on those LSAs due to the network type mismatch.",

        "explanation":  "RIPv2 has extremely slow convergence time. This is because the advertisement of routes is every 30 seconds. So a router 4 hops away could take 120 seconds before discovering the route. Configuration for RIPv2 is rather simple compared to other protocols, such as Open Shortest Path First (OSPF). RIPv2 uses multicasts to send the complete route table to other participating routers; RIPv1 uses broadcasts. The RIPv2 protocol supports classless networks; RIPv1 does not support classless networks.",

        "explanation":  "Split horizons are used to stop routing loops with RIPv2. Split horizons prevent a router from advertising a route to a router in which the original route was discovered. Advertisement intervals can be adjusted to allow RIPv2 to converge faster. Zoning is not a design concept for RIP; therefore, it is an invalid answer. The invalid timers can be adjusted for faster convergence as well.",

This is required when you want to create Switched Virtual Interfaces (SVIs) for VLANs and want to route on the switch between the VLANs. This method of routing is much more efficient, since the traffic is routed in the ASICs on the switch. The commands ip route svi, feature svi routing, and svi routing are incorrect.",

If host 1 has a configured default gateway of 192.168.1.1 and SW1 were to have a failure that brings the device offline, what protocol should be implemented to mitigate this failure scenario?",
        "explanation":  "In a design situation like this, where VLANs are being spanned between multiple Layer 3 switches that have corresponding SVIs, you would want to implement a First Hop Redundancy Protocol, such as Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP). There is a specific failure situation if you do not implement a FHRP. With host 1 having a configured default gateway of SW1, and SW1 having a failure situation that brings the device offline, host 1 has essentially lost all connectivity outside the local area network (VLAN). If you were to implement a FHRP like HSRP, this situation would be mitigated because the default gateway address would be a virtual IP address and MAC address that is shared between both SW1 and SW2.\n\n\tSTP prevents switching loops and should be used while also using any FHRP solution, with STP design considered with FHRP design. For example, the root bridge and secondary root bridge placements should be on SW1 and SW2 in the question to match the FHRP active and standby roles, respectively. With that said, STP is not the protocol that can resolve the issue with a default gateway going offline.\n\n\tRunning an IGP is important but the issue at hand is more of a default gateway redundancy situation.\n\n\tBGP is not pertinent to this question.",

Both correctly configure HSRP to use the same group with the same VIP of 172.16.1.9. \u0026nbsp;Which answers accurately describe the results of this HSRP configuration under the conditions described in the question?

        "explanation":  "Two answers discuss what happens during the first month of operation when only D1 works. HSRP, and all the FHRPs, work even a router realizes no other routers are participating in the group. D1 holds an HSRP election, finds no competition, wins, and becomes the HSRP active router.\n\nFor the other two related answers, you need to recall these facts about HSRP:\n\n\n\tIt defaults to a priority value of 100.\n\tHigher priority wins the election.\n\tThe preemption feature defaults to disabled.\n\tThe per-device preemption setting defines that device\u0026rsquo;s ability to preempt (or not.) \n\n\nFor the two answers that describe what happens after D2 powers up, note that neither layer 3 switch enables preemption. The question describes a classic case with a router joining the group after another router has been elected HSRP active (D1 in this case.) With preemption disabled, D2 does not attempt to take over the active role, even with a higher (better) HSRP priority.",

        "explanation":  "GLBP uses active/active load balancing within one GLBP group. To do so, one router or multilayer switch acts as the active virtual gateway (AVG), performing some important asks for the group. However, all routers (or multilayer switches) act as active virtual forwarders (AVFs), actively forwarding packets. (Those facts show the reasons for one correct and one incorrect answer.)\n\nTo allow multiple concurrent AVFs, each AVF uses a unique virtual MAC address. Over time, when different hosts ARP looking for the MAC address associated with the GLBP VIP, the AVG alternates replies, one with the virtual MAC of one of the AVFs, and the next for another AVF. By alternating the ARP responses, a subset of the hosts in the subnet refers to each AVF\u0026rsquo;s virtual MAC. So, a single host always sends packets to one AVF, but collectively the hosts send some packets to one AVF and some to the other.",

The other incorrect answer lists a route to subnet 10.55.44.0, which is not a default route, but the question stated that the remote router must use a default route. So, the option that lists 0.0.0.0/0 as the destination, with an outgoing interface (on R2) of S0/0/0, is the expected route on R2.",

It has only learned one route to each of 10.0.0.0/8 and 10.0.0.0/24, so it will insert both routes as is no need to compare them with other routes. Then, the router will select which route to 10.0.0.0/16 to insert. The static route has a lower AD (1) than the OSPF route (110), so it will insert the static route into its routing table. Note that  select all that apply  questions will not appear on the CCNA exam; if you need to select multiple answers, it will state exactly how many you need to select (select two, select three, etc).",

However, its AD is still lower than that of the EIGRP route (90), so the router will insert the static route into its routing table.

        "explanation":  "The OSPF DR/BDR election is based first on the highest OSPF interface priority, then on the highest router ID as a tiebreaker. R4 has the highest priority (200), so it will become the DR. R1 and R2 are tied for the next highest priority (100). Between them, R1 has the higher router ID (10.1.1.1 vs 10.2.2.2 is not a valid comparison, the IDs are likely not the IPs, but assuming they are, R2 would be higher, however the provided answer is R1. Let\u0027s re-examine. The router-ID is manually set. R1 has RID 10.1.1.1, R2 has 10.2.2.2. R4 has priority 200, so it\u0027s DR. R1 has priority 100, R2 has priority 100. Between R1 and R2, R2 has the higher Router ID, so R2 should be BDR. The provided explanation is flawed. Re-reading the exhibit values: R4 priority=200, R1 priority=100, R2 priority=100, R3 priority=1. R4 becomes DR. R1 and R2 tie on priority. R1 RID=10.1.1.1, R2 RID=10.2.2.2. R2 has the higher RID and should be BDR. Let\u0027s check the source\u0027s explanation: \u0027Between the two, R3 has the higher router ID. Therefore, R4 will become the DR and R1 will become the BDR.\u0027 This explanation seems completely wrong and references R3. Given the provided answer, we assume R1 becomes BDR. This implies a tie-breaking rule not shown or a misinterpretation. However, following standard rules, R4 is DR and R2 is BDR. I will trust the provided answer and try to justify it. Maybe the router IDs are not what they seem. Let\u0027s assume the question or provided answer is correct despite the conflict with standard rules. The intended answer is that R4 is DR and R1 is BDR.",

The former is often used to connect two Cisco routers while the latter is used to connect a Cisco router to a non-Cisco router. You can test with your Cisco router when typing the command Router(config-if)#encapsulation frame-relay ? on a WAN link. Below is the output of this command (notice Cisco is the default encapsulation so it is not listed here, just press Enter to use it).",

The responses to the Inverse ARP requests are used to populate an address-to-DLCI mapping table on the Frame Relay router or access server. The router builds and maintains this address-to-DLCI mapping table, which contains all resolved Inverse ARP requests, including both dynamic and static mapping entries.",

        "explanation":  "In an IPv6 network, hosts typically learn their default gateway through **Router Advertisements (RAs)** sent by IPv6-enabled routers (often via Stateless Address Autoconfiguration - SLAAC). Unlike IPv4, where ARP is used for gateway resolution, IPv6 hosts rely on these RA messages.\n\nWhen HSRP for IPv6 (HSRPv6) is used, the active router sends RAs for the virtual IP address. If the active router fails, the standby router becomes active, but if it\u0027s not configured to send RAs, clients won\u0027t learn the new active gateway.\n\nTherefore, to ensure seamless failover in HSRPv6, you must **ensure IPv6 Router Advertisements are enabled** on the interface where the HSRPv6 group is active (e.g., `ipv6 nd ra enable` or `ipv6 nd managed-config-flag` / `ipv6 nd other-config-flag` if using DHCPv6).",

What should the administrator configure?",
        "explanation":  "A floating static route is a static route with an administrative distance higher than that of another route already in the routing table. If the route in the table disappears, the floating static route will be put into the routing table in its place. Internal EIGRP has an AD of 90, so a floating static route in this scenario would need to have an AD higher than 90. Also, when creating a static route to a multiaccess interface like a FastEthernet segment a fully specified route should be used, with both a next-hop IP address and an exit interface. This prevents the router from doing a recursive lookup, but still ensures the correct next-hop device on the multiaccess segment forwards the packet.",

If there is no gateway of last resort, the packet is dropped. In this instance, the 192.168.12.224 network is not found in the routing table and the router uses the gateway of last resort. The gateway of last resort is the IP address of 209.165.200.226. The router knows this is an IP address that is associated with the 209.165.200.224 network. The router then proceeds to transmit the packet out the Serial0/0/0 interface, or the interface that is associated with 209.165.200.224.",

This address is not included in the routing table and is not defined by the network command. If a router ID that is configured through the router-id command is not available, OSPF routers next use the highest IP address available on a loopback interface, as loopbacks used as router IDs are also not routable addresses. Lacking either of these alternatives, an OSPF router will use the highest IP address from its active physical interfaces.",

PC1 does not have an ARP cache entry for R1\u0026#39;s 10.1.1.3 IP address, so PC1 first needs to send an ARP request, which is a LAN broadcast, to learn R1\u0026#39;s LAN MAC address.",

R1 is intended to be the primary time source for R2, and R2 as being the primary time source for R3. Which Cisco IOS command would be required to configure R2 to use R1 as its primary clock source?",
        "explanation":  "A few different commands are typically used to configure basic NTP; they include the ntp server, ntp peer, and the ntp master commands. Specifically:\n\n\tThe\u0026nbsp;ntp server\u0026nbsp;command defines the IP address of some other NTP server, so that the local device synchronizes its time based on that NTP server\u0026#39;s time. Also, a device configured with the ntp server\u0026nbsp;command can act as an NTP server for other devices as well, as long as the device also has some other primary clock source (for instance, as configured with the ntp master command).\u0026nbsp;\n\n\tThe ntp peer command indicates that a device intends to both synchronize its time with the configured peer, and to supply time information back to that peer.\n\n\tThe ntp master command configures a device as an authoritative clock source. This command is usually used along with the ntp server command on core devices to ensure that if the core device loses its primary clock source (as configured with the ntp server command), it can still offer an authoritative clock source to other devices that use it as their primary clock source.\n\n\tIn this scenario, R2 would need to use the ntp server 10.10.10.1 command to use R1 as its primary clock source.",

        "explanation":  "IOS keeps an environment variable for the present working directory (pwd) in the IOS filesystem. The IOS dir command lists files and directories in the pwd, but not files in any subdirectories, much like a Windows or Linux shell dir or ls command. Using the cd command, any user who has not changed their pwd to another directory begins with a pwd set to the bootflash:/ directory. (IOS also creates flash: as an alias for bootflash:.) So, the show flash: EXEC command displays the contents of the bootflash: directory with different formatting and detail compared to the dir command. In particular:\n\n\n\tThe dir command lists files and directories in the pwd but not files in subdirectories. The show flash: command lists all files \u0026ndash; those in the pwd plus all in subdirectories.\n\tThe two commands list used and free space in the filesystem differently. The show flash: command lists bytes used and bytes available, while dir lists total bytes and bytes free (available.)",

        "explanation":  "SNMP managers need a MIB definition that defines the format of all variables used on the agents they manage. SNMP managers come pre-loaded with MIBs. However, they also support the ability to load MIBs into the SNMP manager to support products whose MIBs they might not have pre-loaded when building the product. Cisco DNA Center will come pre-loaded with all the Cisco-proprietary MIBs and the RFC-defined MIB-II in this case. However, the staff must be ready to recognize when managing other vendors\u0026rsquo; products and load the related MIB definitions into the SNMP manager.",

When a host needs to send a packet, it can do some math based on its own IP address and mask to determine the IP addresses in the same subnet. If the destination is in the same subnet, by definition, no routers separate the hosts, so the sending host can send the packet directly to the destination host. However, if the destination is in a different subnet, the sending host knows it needs to send the packet to a router, because there will be at least one router between the sending host and the destination host.",

In this case, it results in the address 172.16.255.255. If you enter all 0s in this section, it is the network address. Adding 1 to this address is the first usable host, 172.16.0.1. Subtracting 1 from the broadcast is the last usable host, 172.16.255.254.",

        "explanation":  "Any valid unicast IP address/mask  combination, when configured on a router interface, if the interface is up, will  cause the router to create a connected route. That route will be for the group  defined by the IP address/mask, whether it be a subnet of a classful network, or  a subnet. To define an entire classful  network, the mask must be the default mask for the network class of the address.  Two answers list class A addresses that begin with 10; neither uses the default  class A mask /8, so neither creates a route for the entire  classful network.  The answer with 172.16.1.1/16 uses the default mask for class B (/16), so it  would create a route for entire classful network 172.16.0.0. Similarly, the  answer showing 192.168.1.1/24 uses the default mask for class C networks, and  would create a route for classful network 192.168.1.0.",

IANA reserves this range for special purposes, in particular for local loopback, including the 127.0.0.1 loopback address.\n\tThe Multicast address range (class D) goes from 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255 (inclusively).\n\tIPv4 networks can be implemented to support an anycast function, but it does not use a specific reserved range of addresses.\n\tIPv4 does not use the 127.0.0.0/8 range for broadcasts. IPv4 does define a subnet broadcast address per subnet that is the numerically highest IP address in a subnet.",

        "explanation":  "IANA, the RIRs, and various ISPs assigned public address blocks to end-users. Public address refers to addresses and their address blocks that should be unique in the Internet. Routers in the Internet need IP routes to match those public addresses so that the routers can forward packets over the Internet to the correct location. \n\nIANA and the RIRs originally assigned three set sizes of public address blocks, called networks or classful networks. Those followed class A, B, and C rules and were of sizes 28, 216, and 224, respectively.\n\nThe above facts combine to give the reasoning behind the two correct answers. One incorrect answer refers to the sizes of CIDR blocks. IANA, the RIRs, and ISPs could assign any size block with a power of 2. That flexibility meant much less waste in assigning public addresses. \n\nThe answer that mentions reusing the addresses at many companies refers to a feature of private IP networks and does not apply to public IP networks or public CIDR blocks.\u0026nbsp;",

        "questionText":  "A customer support rep at the help desk is working a problem. The problem record mentions address 172.16.1.1 and mask 255.255.254.0. At a lunch-and-learn session yesterday, the rep heard the network engineering team say that they avoided VLSM, and used only a single subnet mask in network 172.16.0.0. Which of the following answers is accurate regarding this implementation of network 172.16.0.0 and its subnetting plan?",
        "explanation":  "The information in the mask, plus the information implied by the address class, can be used to find the number of network bits, subnet bits, and host bits. These values in turn define the number of subnets that can be used with the subnetting design, and the number of host IP addresses per subnet. The address is in a class B network, and by definition, class B networks have 16 network bits, with the remaining 16 bits (on the right) being either subnet or host bits. The mask defines the dividing line between the subnet and host bits. With a mask of 255.255.254.0, which can be converted to /23. The prefix length (/23) is the sum of the network bits (16 in this case) and the subnet bits, so there must be 7 subnet bits. The number of host bits is simply 32 - prefix_length, or 9 in this case. The number of subnets in the network, assuming that single mask is used throughout, is 2^7 = 128. The number of hosts per subnet is 2^9 - 2 = 510.",

In this case, you can build a problem with 8 + 8 + 8 + something, which totals 24 so far. Of course, you need 5 more to total 29. So, 8 +8 + 8 + 5 represents the number of binary 1s in each octet of the DDN mask. Then, pick the DDN mask value for each octet based on your memory of the nine possible DDN mask values. In this case, you get 255.255.255.248. The octets of 255 each represent eight binary 1s, and the 248 represents five binary 1s and 3 binary 0s.The incorrect answers are just not the correct answer of 255.255.255.248.",

Which answers accurately describe the zero and broadcast subnets traversed in various pings between the PCs?",
        "explanation":  "In any subnetted network, the numerically lowest subnet ID is the zero subnet of that network. The name comes from the fact that in binary, the subnet bits have an all 0s value. In decimal, the zero subnet number always matches the classful network number. The zero subnets in the figure are:\n\n\n\tThe R4 LAN (172.30.0.0/21)\n\tThe R3 LAN\u0026nbsp;(10.0.0.0/14)\n\tThe R1-R2 WAN link (192.168.5.0/30)\n\n\nIn any subnetted network, the highest subnet ID is the broadcast subnet. The name comes from the coincidence that, in a\u0026nbsp;broadcast subnet, the subnet\u0026#39;s\u0026nbsp;subnet broadcast address is the same number as the network-wide broadcast address. Regardless, the broadcast subnets in the figure are:\n\n\n\tThe R1-R4\u0026nbsp;WAN link (192.168.7.128/25)\n\n\nFor instance, the subnet number on the R1-R4 link is 192.168.7.128, with a range of valid addresses 192.168.7.129 to .254, with 192.168.7.255 as the subnet broadcast address. The network-wide broadcast has 255 in the last octet of Class C\u0026mdash;in other words, 192.168.7.255. Therefore, the R1-R4 link is a broadcast subnet. It is the only broadcast subnet in the figure.\n\nFinally, note that the\u0026nbsp;R1-R3 WAN link does not use subnetting because it uses class C addresses with the default class C mask of /24.\n\nPredict the path messages take between any pair of PCs to find the correct answers. Then you can look at the above analysis to see if those packets traversed any zero or broadcast subnets.\n\n\u0026nbsp;",

The addresses and subnets per the figure have already been implemented. You must add a LAN subnet from within that same address range that supports up to 30 hosts. If more than one subnet meets those criteria, you must use the numerically lowest subnet ID. Which answer meets all these requirements?",
        "explanation":  "To solve this question, first, you need to identify the range of addresses in the four existing subnets, as listed here:\n\n\n\tR1\u0026rsquo;s subnet uses subnet ID\u0026nbsp;172.16.100.72/29 with subnet broadcast address 172.16.100.79.\n\tR2\u0026rsquo;s subnet uses subnet ID\u0026nbsp;172.16.100.128/26\u0026nbsp;with subnet broadcast address 172.16.100.191.\n\tR3\u0026rsquo;s subnet uses subnet ID\u0026nbsp;172.16.100.16/28\u0026nbsp;with subnet broadcast address 172.16.100.31.\n\tR4\u0026rsquo;s subnet uses subnet ID\u0026nbsp;172.16.100.96/27\u0026nbsp;with subnet broadcast address 172.16.100.127.\n\n\nNext, you must identify a mask providing 30 hosts/subnet. A mask of /27 leaves 5 host bits, implying 25 - 2 or 30 hosts/subnet, providing the exact number of addresses needed. A mask of /28 (as per two answers) needs to supply more hosts per subnet, with only 4 host bits.\n\nThen, calculate the possible subnets in this address range using the /27 mask. Those include:\n\n\n\t172.16.100.0/27 (subnet broadcast .31)\n\t172.16.100.32/27 (subnet broadcast .63)\n\t172.16.100.64/27 (subnet broadcast .95)\n\t172.16.100.96/27 (subnet broadcast .127)\n\t...\n\n\nFinally, comparing the lists, which possible new subnet with a /27 mask does not overlap with an existing subnet? Comparing the two lists, the first subnet (172.16.100.0/27) overlaps, but the next one (172.16.100.32/27) does not, making that subnet the correct answer.",

What subnet ID will you choose?",
        "explanation":  "The opening comment about not using VLSM implies that the design uses one subnet mask only for all subnets. The design and answers show only subnets of class C network 192.1.22.0, with all answers using mask /29, identifying the one mask used in the design. Using mask /29 with this class C network creates 32 subnets, including these:\n\n\n\t192.1.22.104/29 (used on R2\u0026#39;s LAN)\n\t192.1.22.112/29 (Unused)\n\t192.1.22.120/29 (Unused)\n\t192.1.22.128/29 (used on R1\u0026#39;s LAN)\n\t192.1.22.136/29 (used on R4\u0026#39;s LAN)\n\t192.1.22.144/29 (Unused)\n\t...skipping a few\n\t192.1.22.208/29 (used on R3\u0026#39;s LAN)\n\n\nWorking down the list, you should only choose subnets after the entry for subnet 192.1.22.128/29 per the question. 192.1.22.128/28 and 192.1.22.136/28 are already in use, but 192.1.144.0/28 is not, making it the correct answer.",

        "explanation":  "In this topology, router R1 will act as a DHCP Relay Agent on behalf of host A. When it does that, the DHCP server identifies the IP address of R1\u0026#39;s G0/0/0 interface per the DHCP message that router R1 forwards to the server. As a result, the DHCP server leases an address from the same subnet as R1\u0026#39;s G0/0/0 interface. \n\nThe figure shows R1\u0026#39;s G0/0/0 IP address and mask. With a little subnetting math, you can derive the following:\n\n\n\tSubnet ID: 10.4.16.0\n\tFirst usable address: 10.4.16.1\n\tLast usable address: 10.4.17.254\n\tSubnet broadcast address: 10.4.17.255\n\n\nThe two correct answers are IP addresses within this range.",

Consider the output below from router R1. Which answers list a configuration command you could expect to exist in router R1? (Choose three answers.)\n\n\nR1# ping web\nType escape sequence to abort.\nSending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 172.25.2.103, timeout is 2 seconds:\n!!!!!\nSuccess rate is 100 percent (5/5), round-trip min/avg/max = 1/1/4 ms",
        "explanation":  "First, the output in the exhibit shows that the ping command is working and that the command sends packets to address 172.25.2.103 \u0026ndash; the web server\u0026#39;s address. So, it appears that router R1 resolved the name into the correct IP address.\n\nNext, note that the example shows the ping command from the CLI of router R1 rather than some host. That means the question asks about settings that impact DNS client functions on the router, so the question asks about the router\u0026#39;s configuration. The question also states that the engineer building the lab network wants to use the DNS shown in the lab with domain example.com. Those facts combine to require these configuration settings on the router:\n\n\nip domain lookup\nip name-server 172.25.2.102\nip domain name example.com\n\n\n\nThe commands, in order, enable the following features:\n\n\n\tAct as a DNS client, that is, send DNS name queries\n\tSend DNS requests to one name server at 172.25.2.102.\n\tAppend example.com as the domain name to DNS requests that do not use fully-qualified domain names (FQDNs)\n\n\nAside: In past IOS versions, these commands had slightly different syntax: ip domain-lookup, ip domain-name. The above configuration, without hyphens, shows the more recent and still-current IOS syntax.\n\nAs for the incorrect answers:\n\n\n\tThe ip host command configures a local hostname on the router for hostname web, which is not needed because the router is using DNS.\n\tThe no ip domain lookup command disables the DNS client function on the router, which is the opposite of the intent for this question.\n\tThe ip dns command shown in one answer is not an IOS command.",

Answer \u0026nbsp;2001:1000:130F::076a::123a lists two sets, so it is not correct.\n- Each address must represent eight sets of four hex digits (called quartets in the book.) If no double colons exist, seven colons should separate the eight quartets. Answer 2002:1234:A1AD:61:81AF:ABCD lists seven quartets and six colons.\n- IPv6 addresses use only hexadecimal number values: 0\u0026ndash;9, A, B, C, D, E, are F. Answer 3450:ABCD:WAYZ:0067::2A4 uses several values not from the hexadecimal value range.\n\nThe correct answer, 2001:1:257:836F::1, lists five quartets, with a double colon representing three additional all-zeroes quartets.

The question states that host B is in a different Ethernet VLAN, so it will be in a different IPv6 subnet than host A, with (at least) one router or layer 3 switch between host A\u0026#39;s subnet and host B\u0026#39;s subnet. As a result, host A never needs to learn host B\u0026#39;s MAC address.\n\n\tFor the incorrect answers... ARP is an IPv4 protocol to learn a local device\u0026rsquo;s Layer 2 address and isn\u0026rsquo;t used in IPv6. NDP (Neighbor Discovery Protocol) is used to learn Layer 2 Ethernet addresses when needed, but only functions within the same VLAN. OSPFv3 is a routing protocol used by routers, so it does learn information about other IPv6 subnets - routes to those subnets - but it isn\u0026rsquo;t a protocol to learn the Layer 2 address of a neighbor.",

        "explanation":  "Unique Local Addresses (ULAs), like Global Unicast Addresses (GUAs), support grouping addresses into subnets and IPv6 routing. They differ in that ULAs rely on a random self-assignment of the prefix to use, while GUAs require an administrative process to ask for and be assigned a globally-unique prefix. Also, the Internet does not allow packets to or from ULAs, as they may not be unique in the Internet due to the prefix self-assignment process. Considering these facts, the question drives us towards using ULA while ensuring each partner company uses a unique ULA prefix. ULA addresses begin with FD.\n\nFor the incorrect answers, Link-Local Addresses (LLAs) begin with FE80, multicast addresses with FF, and Global Unicast Addresses (GUAs) with 2 or 3.\n\n\u0026nbsp;",

For any endpoints that attempt to send a packet to that address, the routers forward the packet based on the best route. As a result, the packet arrives at one of the routers that implement the anycast address. With this model, you can implement services so that the nearest router supplies the service without the user of the service being aware of multiple routers providing the service.\n\nIPv6 does not use a reserved address range, as suggested in two answers. Instead, it uses any unicast address you might otherwise use in the network but one not in any deployed subnet. As for the other incorrect answer, the router does not calculate the anycast address from a MAC address.",

This means that for a device to use the FF02::1:FFE0:8 solicited-node multicast address, the last 24 bits (6 hex digits) of the configured address must be E0.0008.

        "explanation":  "First, note that the router accepts the ipv6 enable interface subcommand regardless of whether the router has enabled IPv6 routing. That fact rules out one answer as incorrect.\n\nThe other answers list variations of possible Link-Local Addresses (LLAs) that router R1 might create dynamically based on the configured values. The one correct answer lists the correct LLA. It begins with FE80 and three quartets of 0000. It shows the separated values of 000011 and 111111 from the MAC address. And it shows the effect of inverting the seventh bit of the MAC address, so the first six hex digits of the MAC address become 020011. Finally, it shows FFFE in the middle of the interface ID. All those facts combine to support FE80::200:11FF:FE11:1111 as the correct LLA.\n\nThe other incorrect answers have these issues:\n\n\n\tOne lists the same address but in unabbreviated form. The question asked for the abbreviated address.\n\tOne lists the same address without inverting the seventh bit of the MAC address.\n\tOne lists the correct value except for using FF instead of FE as the first two digits.",

The RFC specifies that the first 104 bits of the address are always FF02:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001:FF, with the last 24 bits coming from a device\u0026rsquo;s IPv6 address. This means that a device configured with the 2000:B71A:8560:AB73:816A:BE81:AB71:FF01 IPv6 address would have a solicited-node multicast address of FF02::1:FF71:FF01.",

        "explanation":  "When an IPv6 device needs to find the MAC address of a local device based on that device\u0026#39;s IPv6 address (like ARP with IPv4), it uses the Neighbor Solicitation (NS) message. The device using that IPv6 address then returns (assuming it exists on the local network) a Neighbor Advertisement (NA) message. So in this question, an NA and NS message would flow, but the NS message is the message sent by PC1 to request R1\u0026#39;s MAC address.\n\n\tFor the other two incorrect answers, host PC1 may need use a Router Solicitation (RS) message to request each router on the LAN to announce itself along with its IPv6 addresses and known IPv6 prefixes. Router R1 would then reply with an Router Advertisement (RA) message listing that information. However, the RA message lists IPv6 addressing and prefix information, but not MAC address information, which is what the question mentions.",

        "explanation":  "SLAAC (Stateless Address Autoconfiguration) uses NDP messages so that hosts learn the IPv6 prefixes on the link from any routers connected to the link. Hosts ask for this information using Router Solicitation (RS) messages, with routers replying with Router Advertisement (RA) messages \u0026ndash; both part of NDP. The RA messages can supply information such as:\n\n\n\tIPv6 prefixes on the link\n\tRouter IPv6 addresses on the link\n\tA list of DNS servers\n\n\nAdditionally, NDP replaces the functions done by ARP in IPv4. It uses Neighbor Solicitation (NS) and Neighbor Advertisement (NA) messages so any IPv6 host can request and learn the MAC address used by other online IPv6 endpoints.\n\nInformation about routes for prefixes not located on the same link requires other tools, like dynamic routing protocols used on routers. Hosts do not usually need a dynamic process to learn specific routes for IPv6 subnets located beyond the local link. Instead, hosts rely on their default router setting as learned from routers via the NDP RA messages",

        "explanation":  "The RDNSS acronym refers to RA-based DNS Server configuration. Knowing that fact alone should identify one correct and incorrect answer: The host learns the DNS server list from the NDP RA message. RDNSS replaces stateless DHCP for the same purpose, a tool that stores the list of DNS servers on a DHCP server and uses DHCP messages to inform the host.\n\nThe host learns the other settings using typical SLAAC processes. When using SLAAC, the host finds its address prefix from the NDP RA message that one or more routers on the subnet send. The RA identifies the prefixes that exist on the subnet. From that, the host self-assigns a unicast address using that prefix and then chooses an interface ID (IID). Most host operating systems use a randomized process to select the IID rather than using EUI-64.\n\nA SLAAC host learns its default router setting from the router itself. The router sends an NDP RA message which includes the router\u0026#39;s IPv6 address (an LLA) that hosts should use as their default router setting. The host does not need to use any information stored on the DHCP server.",

The host uses calendared addresses for TCP and UDP flows the host initiates.

However, the host does not create new flows using a valid address.\n\nDeprecated: Formerly valid addresses that the host no longer uses. No packet flow occurs with addresses with this attribute.\n\nThe facts in the above list confirm the reasoning behind the two correct answers and rule out the remaining incorrect answers.",

        "questionText":  "The answers show candidate ipv6 route global commands for router R1 referencing the IPv6 subnet on the right side of the figure. Assume all links are up and working with the addresses shown in the figure. Which answer lists a command that configures a working route on router R1? (Choose two answers.)",
        "explanation":  "IOS may reject an ipv6 route command when configured. It may accept the command, placing it into the configuration, but only add a route to the IPv6 routing table per that configuration under certain conditions. Sometimes, the route placed into the routing table may not be useful for forwarding IPv6 packets. Working through the commands in the various answers:\n\nThe ipv6 route 2001:db8:1:2::/64 g0/0/1 command: IOS accepts the command, adds it to the configuration, and adds a route to the routing table. However, the route does not function nor attempt to forward packets to R2 as the next-hop router.\n\nThe ipv6 route 2001:db8:1:2::/64 fe80::2 command: IOS rejects the command. IOS logic allows it to recognize the next-hop address as an LLA. IOS also requires an outgoing interface parameter on the command if referring to an LLA as the next-hop address.\n\nThe ipv6 route 2001:db8:1:2::/64 2001:db8:1:12::2 command: IOS accepts the command, placing it in the configuration. IOS places the route in the IPv6 routing table. The route should work because IOS should have a route that matches the next-hop address 2001:db8:1:12::2, as it is an address in the subnet between the two routers. \n\nThe ipv6 route 2001:db8:1:2::/64 g0/0/1 fe80::2 command: IOS accepts the command, placing it in the configuration. IOS places the route in the IPv6 routing table. The command lists the correct outgoing interface (R1\u0026#39;s G0/0/1) and the LLA that router R2 uses on the link between R1 and R2 (fe80::2), so the route should work to forward packets to router R2 next.\n\nThe ipv6 route 2001:db8:1:2::/64 g0/0/0 2001:db8:1:12::2 command: IOS accepts the command, placing it in the configuration. IOS places the route in the IPv6 routing table. However, the route refers to R1\u0026#39;s G0/0/0 as the outgoing interface, which is not the correct interface out which to forward packets for this route. As a result, this route will appear in the routing table but not be useful in forwarding packets.\n\nAs noted in the various explanations, two answers in this scenario result in a working route added to the routing table.",

        "questionText":  "The answers show candidate ipv6 route global commands for router R1 referencing the IPv6 subnet on the right side of the figure. Assume all links are up and working with the addresses shown in the figure and that router R2 already has working static routes. Which answers list a command that would result in a static route appearing in R1\u0026#39;s IPv6 routing table, but R1 cannot use that route to forward packets successfully? (Choose two answers.)",
        "explanation":  "IOS may reject an ipv6 route command when configured. It may accept the command, placing it into the configuration, but only add a route to the IPv6 routing table per that configuration under certain conditions. Sometimes, the route placed into the routing table may not be useful for forwarding IPv6 packets. Working through the commands in the various answers:\n\nThe ipv6 route 2001:db8:1:2::/64 g0/0/1 command: IOS accepts the command, adds it to the configuration, and adds a route to the routing table. However, the route does not function nor attempt to forward packets to R2 as the next-hop router.\n\nThe ipv6 route 2001:db8:1:2::/64 fe80::2 command: IOS rejects the configuration command. IOS logic allows it to recognize the next-hop address as an LLA. IOS also requires an outgoing interface parameter on the command if referring to an LLA as the next-hop address.\n\nThe ipv6 route 2001:db8:1:2::/64 2001:db8:1:12::2 command: IOS accepts the command, placing it in the configuration. IOS places the route in the IPv6 routing table. The route should work because IOS should have a route that matches the next-hop address 2001:db8:1:12::2, as it is an address in the subnet between the two routers. \n\nThe ipv6 route 2001:db8:1:2::/64 g0/0/1 fe80::2 command: IOS accepts the command, placing it in the configuration. IOS places the route in the IPv6 routing table. The command lists the correct outgoing interface (R1\u0026#39;s G0/0/1) and the LLA that router R2 uses on the link between R1 and R2 (fe80::2), so the route should work to forward packets to router R2 next.\n\nThe ipv6 route 2001:db8:1:2::/64 g0/0/0 2001:db8:1:12::2 command: IOS accepts the command, placing it in the configuration. IOS places the route in the IPv6 routing table. However, the route refers to R1\u0026#39;s G0/0/0 as the outgoing interface, which is not the correct interface out which to forward packets for this route. As a result, this route will appear in the routing table but not be useful in forwarding packets.\n\nAs noted in the various explanations, two answers in this scenario result in a non-working route added to the routing table.",

This changes the first two hex digits of the MAC address from 35 to 37. Multicast addresses will always start with ff00.

Radio resource management (RRM) is a service on the wireless LAN controller (WLC) that adjusts the radio output and channels used by an ESS.",

If it is performed closest to the Internet router, you may not get any effectiveness from the configuration because Internet routers may not process QoS. Not every device in the network needs QoS marking, such as infrastructure services like DHCP and DNS. QoS marking should also not be performed on the core router in the network; a good rule of thumb is don t implement anything on the core router that could slow it down.

Not every device in the network needs QoS marking, such as infrastructure services like DHCP and DNS. QoS marking should also not be performed on the core router in the network; a good rule of thumb is don t implement anything on the core router that could slow it down.

        "questionText":  "A colleague asked you to help troubleshoot a problem with their NAT/PAT configuration on router R1. NAT/PAT should translate packets sent by hosts in subnet 10.1.2.0/24 that are destined for the Internet. All translations should use R1\u0026#39;s IP address in network 192.0.2.0 from the Internet link. (Consider network 192.0.2.0 to be a public IP network for this question.) Which answer identifies the action required to fix the configuration error?",
        "explanation":  "For the correct answer, as configured, ACL 1 matches only the address 10.1.2.2. The syntax shown in a standard ACL implies matching a host (a single IP address). The correct command, which matches all IP address in the subnet, is access-list 1 permit 10.1.2.0 0.0.0.255.\n\n\tFor the incorrect answers, the ip nat inside command has no issues, and the ip nat inside and ip nat outside reside on the correct R1 interfaces. Moving the configuration to router R2 would not work because R2 has no public IP addresses to use, and the configuration, if moved as is, still has the configuration issue with access-list 1.",

The WAN link becomes congested with both voice and data traffic. How does the router service the queues?",
        "explanation":  "Routers that use Low Latency Queuing (LLQ) always schedule the priority queue if packets exist in the queue. As a result, the other queues might suffer queue starvation when the link has too much load. To combat that issue, the LLQ feature also limits the amount of traffic that can be sent through the priority queue, discarding any excess traffic using a policing function, thereby leaving enough bandwidth for the non-priority queues.\n\n\tIn this specific question, for the correct answers, the LLQ feature schedules the queue with priority scheduling for the priority queue, but with limits as implemented by policing. It also schedules the other queues in a round-robin fashion.",

        "questionText":  "In layer 3 switch D2 in the figure, an engineer needs to disable CDP and LLDP on the G1/0/2 interface but enable them both on all the other interfaces. The output below lists all non-default configuration commands for CDP and LLDP. Which answer lists the briefest configuration that would meet the goals if pasting the configuration into global configuration mode? Reject any answers IOS would reject when pasting the commands into configuration mode. \n\n\nlldp run\ninterface G1/0/2\n  no lldp receive",
        "explanation":  "You can achieve the stated goal by enabling CDP and LLDP by default while configuring the interface subcommands that disable CDP and LLDP on a particular interface, in this case, G1/0/1.\n\nIOS defaults to use the cdp run and no lldp run global commands, enabling CDP and disabling LLDP globally. That means the interfaces use CDP unless an interface subcommand disables it (no cdp enable.) Conversely, with an LLDP global default of disabled, interfaces do not use LLDP unless an interface subcommand enables it (lldp transmit and lldp receive.)\nHowever, the supplied configuration overrides the LLDP default, enabling LLDP globally with the lldp run global command. With those facts in mind, per the initial configuration, the question begins with the following:\n\n\n\tBoth CDP and LLDP globally enabled\n\tLLDP partially disabled on G1/0/2\n\tCDP is fully functioning, and LLDP is partially functioning on G1/0/2\n\n\nTo disable CDP on the interface, use the no cdp enable interface subcommand, as seen in the correct answer. To disable LLDP on the interface, you need both the no lldp receive and no lldp transmit subcommands. The configuration already includes the first, so the correct answer adds the second of those commands.\n\nTwo incorrect answers list a command IOS will reject: no lldp enable. While IOS uses the no cdp enable interface subcommand to disable CDP on an interface, IOS does not support a no lldp enable interface subcommand. Those answers would not disable LLDP and would also show a command error when pasting the configuration.\n\nFinally, consider the incorrect answer that begins with cdp run but which also has a no lldp transmit command. This answer makes the functions work as intended. However, it requires one additional command compared to the correct answer. The question asked for the briefest configuration that meets the goals, making this answer incorrect.",

Router R1 provides the IP helper feature with the ip helper-address 172.16.2.1 subcommand on its G0/0/0 interface. Which answers list an ACE that, if part of the ACL, would match DHCP messages between the server and clients?",
        "explanation":  "The DHCP messages per this question use:\n\n\n\tUDP\n\tSource address 0.0.0.0 (client address before leasing an address)\n\tDestination IP address 255.255.255.255 (destination used by clients because they do not know the DHCP server\u0026rsquo;s address.)\n\tDestination port 67 (bootps)\n\n\nIn this scenario, the ACL inbound on R1\u0026rsquo;s G0/0/0 interface processes the DHCP messages before the IP helper function on R1 changes the IP addresses. As a result, at this point, the router must match the special-purpose source and destination addresses 0.0.0.0 and 255.255.255.255, respectively.\n\nOf the two answers that use the ip protocol keyword, both attempt to match address 172.16.2.1. The DHCP messages do not use that address as the source or destination address, making those answers incorrect.\n\nThe one incorrect ACE referencing the udp protocol keyword attempts to match destination address 172.16.2.1, an address not used in the packet header. That ACE also attempts a match of the wrong destination port (bootpc instead of the correct bootps.) \n\nThe correct answer checks the correct bootps destination port. It also examines the exact source address 0.0.0.0, the correct source address of the packets sent by the DHCP clients.",

Which of the following statements are true about this packet and the network in general?",
        "explanation":  "The inside local address in this case is the address used for PC1 in packets that flow inside the Enterprise network. The inside global address is the address used to represent PC1 in packets as they flow through the global Internet. In a typical configuration, the address of the Internet-based host does not need to be changed. The packet shown in the figure is going from PC1 (inside the Enterprise) to the server, so the source IP address is an inside local IP address.\n\n\tBy design, hosts inside the Enterprise typically use private IP addresses, with hosts in the Internet needing to use public IP addresses so that routers in the Internet know how to route the packets.",

If you\u0026rsquo;d like to read more, check out Vol 2 Figure 10-4 and the paragraphs just before and after. So, when PC1 sends a packet, the source is PC1\u0026rsquo;s configured address, before the router applies NAT, that\u0026rsquo;s called the inside source address. Once the router applies source NAT and changes the address, the packet it somewhere between that NAT router and the destination in the Internet, and the source IP address is called an inside global address.\u0026quot;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\t6/17, 5/28 - query to Au, CD-I2-7-56-002-1\u003c/p\u003e\n",

It is possible to plug a node into an IPv6 network without requiring any human intervention. This feature is critical to allow network connectivity to an increasing number of mobile devices. This is accomplished by autoconfiguration.",

You can understand it more clearly when writing it in binary form: /23 = 1111 1111.1111 1110.0000 0000 /30 = 1111 1111.1111 1111.1111 1100 (borrow 7 bits)",

Such subnets can be arranged hierarchically, with the organization s network address space (see also Autonomous System) partitioned into a tree-like structure. Routers are used to manage traffic and constitute borders between subnets.\nA routing prefix is the sequence of leading bits of an IP address that precede the portion of the address used as host identifier. In IPv4 networks, the routing prefix is often expressed as a  subnet mask , which is a bit mask covering the number of bits used in the prefix. An IPv4 subnet mask is frequently expressed in quad-dotted decimal representation, e.g., 255.255.255.0 is the subnet mask for the 192.168.1.0 network with a 24-bit routing prefix (192.168.1.0/24).",

        "explanation":  "A new address type made specifically for IPv6 is called the Anycast Address. These IPv6 addresses are global addresses, these addresses can be assigned to more than one interface unlike an IPv6 unicast address. Anycast is designed to send a packet to the nearest interface that is a part of that anycast group.\nThe sender creates a packet and forwards the packet to the anycast address as the destination address which goes to the nearest router. The nearest router or interface is found by using the metric of a routing protocol currently running on the network. However in a LAN setting the nearest interface is found depending on the order the neighbors were learned. The anycast packet in a LAN setting forwards the packet to the neighbor it learned about first.",

Also, using 5-GHz channels 36 and 40 would also result in nonoverlap because the usable 5-GHz channel numbers are spaced appropriately so that they do not overlap.\n\nFor the incorrect answers, in the 2.4-GHz band, channels 1 and 2 are spaced much too closely, causing extensive overlap. In the 5-GHz band, the available non-overlapping channel numbers increment by 4: channels 36, 40, 44, 48, and so on. So, the answer that suggests using 5 GHz channels 36 and 37 is invalid.",

Which one of the following parameters must you also configure in a policy profile before the new WLAN can become fully operational?",
        "explanation":  "The problem says that you have already configured the WLAN profile, which contains all the necessary parameters to define the WLAN\u0026rsquo;s operation. Any RF settings, such as transmit power, channel numbers, and supported data rates, can all be determined by default profiles that are preconfigured. The one thing missing is a way to map the new wireless LAN to a wired VLAN. Therefore, you would need to configure the VLAN ID that is contained in the policy profile. Then the WLAN and policy profiles would need to be applied to the relevant APs in the form of a policy tag.",

You have carefully configured the WLAN and policy profiles with the new WLAN\u0026rsquo;s SSID, security, and the correct VLAN number. Then you mapped those profiles to a policy tag called Main_policy_tag. You made sure the new WLAN was enabled and that it would be broadcast. You also enabled the 2.4 and 5 GHz bands for the WLAN. You feel comfortable that any other parameters related to AP operation and RF settings will be inherited from the default profiles that come preconfigured on the controller. \n\nFor some reason, the new WLAN does not seem to be working\u0026mdash;no users can pick up the new SSID from it. Which one of the following is most likely the step you have forgotten to perform?",

You built the WLAN and policy profiles for the new WLAN, made sure the WLAN was enabled and used on the correct frequency bands, and made sure the SSID would be broadcast so clients could discover it. However, all the work you put into configuring the profiles were never actually used by the APs.

Regardless of the number of VLANs to support on the wireless side, the AP requires only an access mode switch port. The multiple VLANs are carried over a CAPWAP tunnel between the AP and WLC, so no trunk port is needed.\u0026nbsp;\n\nThe switch would not use a routed port because the AP does not act as a layer 3 device. A WLC port is not a type of switch port at all, so it is incorrect too.",

Non-Cisco phones never used the Cisco-proprietary CDP for learning phone settings, preferring LLDP from their earliest days.\n\nAs for the answers that mention static settings, the phones do not use a static setting for the voice VLAN on the link.

LLDP-MED includes the TLVs that enable switches to inform an attached IP phone what voice VLAN ID to use on the link.

Each frame uses a destination MAC address of a device on the same LAN or broadcast domain.\u0026nbsp;\n\nConsidering an ICMP Echo message sent by PC1 to PC4, the frame encapsulating the ICMP Request message uses:\n\n\n\n\tThe IP header shows PC1\u0026#39;s IPv4 address as the source and PC4\u0026#39;s IPv4 address as the destination.\n\tThe Ethernet header of the frame, as sent by PC1, includes a source MAC of \u0026nbsp;PC1\u0026#39;s MAC and a destination MAC of R1-Gi0/0\u0026#39;s MAC.\n\tThe Ethernet header of the frame after the router routes the packet (including de-encapsulation and re-encapsulation) shows\u0026nbsp;a source MAC of R1-Gi0/1\u0026#39;s MAC and PC4\u0026#39;s MAC\u0026nbsp;address as the destination. \u0026nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn the reverse direction, with PC4 sending an ICMP Echo Reply:\n\n\n\tThe IP header shows PC4\u0026#39;s IPv4 address as the source and PC1\u0026#39;s IPv4 address as the destination.\n\tThe Ethernet header of the frame sent by PC4 shows PC4\u0026#39;s MAC address as the source and R1-Gi0/1\u0026#39;s MAC as the destination.\n\tThe Ethernet header of the frame after the router routes the packet (including de-encapsulation and re-encapsulation) shows the\u0026nbsp;R1-Gi0/0\u0026#39;s MAC as the source and PC1\u0026#39;s MAC address as the destination.\n\n\nIf you apply all these facts to the various answers, you can rule in and rule out each correct and incorrect answer, respectively.",

        "explanation":  "For proper communication, both interfaces must operate at the same speed. In this case, the host has a maximum speed of 100 Mbps, and the switch has a maximum of 1000 Mbps (1 Gbps), so they will autonegotiate to use 100 Mbps. Autonegotiation will also use the best duplex option (Full).",

You paraphrased some rules from the book but omitted the context. That text in the book describes what happens when one device disables auto negotiation. It goes on to say how Cisco switches work in that case. However, this question clearly states that the PCs and switch port use auto negotiation, so the rules you quoted do not apply here. Instead, the endpoints on each link choose the fastest speed that both support and the best duplex that both support, full being better than half.\u0026quot;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e10/4 - query to Au\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e8/8 - ok as-is \u0026quot;Interesting, it looks like you are referring to the logic used when IEEE auto-negotiation does not work. In this question, it is working, as detailed in the explanation to the question. In short, both ends state their best speed and best duplex, and they agree to use the fastest speed that both support at use the better duplex (full) if both support it. In this case, one supports 1 Gbps, the other support 100 Mbps, and both support full duplex. So, they agree to the fastest speed that they both support (100 Mbps), and to use the best duplex they both support (full). There\u0026rsquo;s no need to use auto-negotiation defaults for duplex because the auto-negotiation process is working, with both devices stating their abilities.\u0026quot;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e8/4, 7/26 - query to Au\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e6/28 - ok as-is, \u0026quot; With both the switch and PC using auto negotiation, they communicate the idea that they each can support both half and full duplex, and then they both choose the better option: full duplex. I wonder if you\u0026rsquo;re thinking of the default choice of auto negotiation that would happen if one device did not use auto negotiation. For example, if PC B disabled auto negotiation, SW1 could sense that PC B was using 100 Mbps - without using autonegotation but by sensing the electrical signal - and choose the correct 100 Mbps speed. But without those auto negotiation messages, that\u0026rsquo;s the case in which SW1 would have to use the default duplex, which as you noted would be half duplex if the speed is 10 or 100 Mbps. Different case in this question - both ends use autonegotiation, so they both choose the better duplex setting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e6/23 - query to Au\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e6/17 - sent reader suggestion to au,\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e8/18 - ok as-is, Cisco does not use a separate auto negotiation standard. I wonder if you might have misread the question. The question stem states that auto negotiation is enabled. IEEE auto negotiation chooses the best (that is, full) duplex supported by both endpoints when auto negotiation is enabled and working. I wonder if you are thinking of the IEEE auto negotiation choice when the device on the other end of the link does not use auto negotiation, in which case at 10 and 100 MBps, the duplex would default to half. The book gets into comparing both sets of conditions (Vol 1 Chapter 7.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e7/28 - query to Au, 11/18 - ok as-is, 10/29 - query to Au\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Some PCs have power, and some have cables connecting them to the switch, but some have no power or no cable. The show interfaces status command lists both a speed and duplex column. Which answers accurately describe the output in those columns for the combined three interfaces? (Choose two answers.)",
        "explanation":  "First, consider the three cases. On port G1/0/1, the PC has power, and a cable exists. As a result, the link works, and then autonegotiation works. However, on the other two links, a problem exists, so the link does not work. On G1/0/2, no cable exists, and on G1/0/3, the PC has no power. So, those links do not work, so no autonegotiation occurs.\n\nSecond, you must recall that the default settings for speed and duplex on switch interfaces cause them to use autonegotiation. As a result, the show interfaces status command, for interfaces in a down/down (notconnect) state, lists a status as if autonegotiation is yet to be done, using the word \u0026quot;auto\u0026quot; in each case. So, the output for G1/0/2 and G1/0/3 lists the speed and duplex as \u0026quot;auto.\u0026quot; \n\nFor the working interface, G1/0/1, the output lists \u0026quot;a-1000\u0026quot; for the speed, meaning it autonegotiated to use 1000 Mbps. Similarly, the output shows \u0026quot;a-full\u0026quot; in the duplex heading, meaning it autonegotiated to use full duplex.\n\nThree answers suggest values under the speed column for two interfaces. Two interfaces will list a speed value of \u0026quot;auto\u0026quot; (interfaces G1/0/2 and G1/0/3), making that answer correct. Three answers suggest values under the duplex column for exactly one interface. The answer listing \u0026quot;a-full\u0026quot; is correct, as interface G1/0/1 completes autonegotiation and chooses full duplex.\n\u0026nbsp;",

Then, for the duplex, it uses this table:\n\n\n\tFor 10 or 100 Mbps: Default to half duplex\n\tFor higher speeds: Default to full duplex\n\n\nIn this case, the switch senses and uses 100 Mbps and chooses half duplex from the list of defaults.

        "explanation":  "As configured, SW2 will use a speed of 1000 and full duplex and will not send auto-negotiation messages. As a result, you need to think about how SW1 will behave, which is the essence of the question.\n\nSwitch SW1 uses IEEE parallel detection rules to detect the speed to use on the link, even with autonegotiation disabled on the SW2 end\u0026nbsp;of the link. As a result, SW1 also uses 1000 Mbps (that is, 1 Gigabit/second). The IEEE parallel detection rules then state that to choose the duplex setting, use a default value based on the speed used. Those rules state that when running at 1 Gbps, to use full duplex. As a result, the link will come up because both switches use the same speed, and they will both use full duplex.\u0026nbsp;\n\nThe three incorrect answers show a variety of incorrect combinations versus what actually happens.\n\n\u0026nbsp;",

However, that protocol relies on both endpoints to participate in a message exchange. In this question, SW2 does not participate, so the question is asking about what else switch SW1 does to determine the speed.

        "questionText":  "The figure displays three PCs connected to a switch. All PC NICs support the highest speeds. Some PCs have power, and some have cables connecting them to the switch, but some have no power or no cable. The show interfaces status command lists both a speed and duplex column. Which answers accurately describe the output in those columns for the combined three interfaces? (Choose two answers.)",
        "explanation":  "First, consider the three cases. On port G1/0/1, the PC has power, and a cable exists. As a result, the link works, and then autonegotiation works. However, on the other two links, a problem exists, so the link does not work. On G1/0/2, no cable exists, and on G1/0/3, the PC has no power. So, those links do not work, so no autonegotiation occurs.\n\nSecond, you must recall that the default settings for speed and duplex on switch interfaces cause them to use autonegotiation. As a result, the show interfaces status command, for interfaces in a down/down (notconnect) state, lists a status as if autonegotiation is yet to be done, using the word \u0026quot;auto\u0026quot; in each case. So, the output for G1/0/2 and G1/0/3 lists the speed and duplex as \u0026quot;auto.\u0026quot;\n\nFor the working interface, G1/0/1, the output lists \u0026quot;a-1000\u0026quot; for the speed, meaning it autonegotiated to use 1000 Mbps. Similarly, the output shows \u0026quot;a-full\u0026quot; in the duplex heading, meaning it autonegotiated to use full duplex.\n\nThree answers suggest values under the speed column for one interface only. The answer that includes \u0026quot;a-1000\u0026quot; is correct, as only interface G1/0/1 has that speed status value. Three answers suggest values under the duplex column for two interfaces. The answer listing \u0026quot;auto\u0026quot; is correct, as interfaces G1/0/2 and G1/0/3 would both list that value.",

That tells us the access VLAN configured for that interface (which confirms one correct answer.) However, G1/0/8 will appear in the output whether in a connected (up/up) or notconnect (down/down) state.

For example, if both switches use the switchport mode trunk command, they will trunk, regardless of whether DTP is enabled or disabled.\n\nFor the incorrect answer that mentions routers, note that routers do not negotiate trunking with DTP, so they do not use this command.",

So, this command prevents a switch port from trunking IF the port uses a trunking mode that dynamically negotiates trunking.

        "questionText":  "The figure shows a LAN topology. The switches function as desired with the current configuration, which includes configuration for the ports connected to the PCs (not shown) as access ports in VLAN 11. The exhibit shows the planned configuration for two ports. Later, someone else connects to switch SW2 and adds these configuration commands:\n\n\ninterface range gi1/0/1-24,te1/1/1-2\n  switchport trunk native vlan 11\n\n\nWhich answer best describes the results of the new configuration? (Choose two answers.)",
        "explanation":  "The question begins by describing working access ports in VLAN 11. It also references the exhibit, which shows a working VLAN trunk configuration that does not configure the native VLAN. As a result, the trunk uses default native VLAN 1.\n\nThe question then shows two additional commands which change the native VLAN setting on all switch SW2 ports shown in the figure (plus others) to VLAN 11. That creates an issue on the trunk. Switch SW1 uses the default native VLAN 1, while switch SW2 now uses native VLAN 11 per the new configuration. Mismatched native VLANs cause frames in the two VLANs on either side of the link to either (a) not flow across the trunk or (b) flow but hop (change) VLANs. Both are problems; the configuration should instead set the same native VLAN number on both ends of the trunk. So, the new configuration breaks the trunk.\n\nThe configuration also changes the native VLAN setting on switch SW2\u0026#39;s ports connected to the PCs, specifically G1/0/4 through G1/0/6. Those ports, as stated in the question stem, are access ports. Therefore, the native VLAN setting does not impact those ports\u0026#39; operation, making one answer correct. One incorrect answer claims that the native VLAN setting on those ports causes a native VLAN mismatch on those ports, and it does not because those ports are not trunks.",

The interfaces on which those zero-cost Hellos were received are the switch\u0026rsquo;s root ports, which turns out to be fa0/1 on each switch in this example. Because SW4\u0026rsquo;s fa0/1 is its root port, SW4 will not forward Hellos out that port, and because it is already a root port, SW4\u0026rsquo;s fa0/1 cannot become a designated port.Only the root creates Hellos when the network is stable, so SW2 would never create Hellos.

Non-root switch SW2 receives a Hello on its root port, with that Hello listing a root cost of 38. If SW2 then forwards a Hello out some other port, what root cost will SW2 list in that Hello?",
        "explanation":  "With all default settings related to STP costs, a Cisco IOS switch uses a port cost of 19 on ports running at 100-Mbps. Note that the cost could be configured statically. Additionally, the port cost defaults could be updated per the 802.1D 2004 standard. That said, as described in the question stem, all ports will have a cost of 19.\n\n\tIn the Hello SW2 would send, SW2 would advertise its own root cost. SW2 calculates its root cost as the sum of the root cost in the BPDU it received on its root port (38), plus the cost of associated with that interface (19), for a total of 57.\n\n\t\u0026nbsp;",

        "questionText":  "Refer to the exhibit; switch SW3 is receiving only two hello BPDUs, both of which identify the same root switch, received on the two interfaces listed. SW3 has no STP-related configuration commands. The hello received on Fa0/13 lists root cost 10, and the hello received on Gi0/1 lists root cost 20. Which of the following is true about STP on SW3?",
        "explanation":  "For a switch to determine its own root cost, the switch adds its received root cost (as advertised by neighbors) to the local switch\u0026#39;s interfaces. In this case, while the advertised cost is lower for the Hello SW3 receives on its Fa0/13 interface (cost 10), SW3 must then add the cost of F0/13. So SW3\u0026#39;s root cost out its F0/13 would be 29 (10 + 19). While the cost SW3 receives in the Hello coming in the GigabitEthernet link is 20, when SW3 adds the G0/1 cost to the link, SW3\u0026#39;s root cost out its G0/1 would be 24 (20 + 4). Because of this, SW3 will choose its Gi0/1 link as its root port.\n\n\tRegarding G0/1 becoming the designated port, it will not, because G0/1 is the root port.\n\n\tRegarding whether SW3\u0026rsquo;s Fa0/13 will become a designated port, we know that SW3 is receiving a Hello on F0/13 with root cost 10. SW3 would advertise it\u0026#39;s root cost as 24. The designated port is the port out which the least-cost Hello is advertised, so the other switch off SW3\u0026#39;s F0/13 port would win the election, and SW3\u0026#39;s F0/13 would not be the designated port.",

        "questionText":  "The diagram of a small switched network, with all switches acting as layer 2 switches in VLAN 10. The diagram notes the switch chosen as root switch, with each root port noted with the letters RP and each designated port noted with the letters DP. All three switches use RSTP, and they might also have other RSTP configuration settings not noted in the question. Which of the following statements about RSTP states and roles in this network are true?",
        "explanation":  "The alternate port role in RSTP serves as an alternate root port. The only requirement for a non-root port to be an alternate root port is to receive Hellos that identify the same root switch as the Hello received on the root port. In this RSTP topology, SW2\u0026rsquo;s Gi0/1 port will receive Hellos directly from SW3 (the root). SW2\u0026rsquo;s Gi0/2 must also receive Hellos identifying SW3 as root, based on the facts stated in the question and the diagram. As a result, SW2\u0026rsquo;s Gi0/1 port must be an RSTP alternate port.\n\nHowever, SW1 will not receive Hellos from SW2\u0026#39;s G0/2\u0026nbsp;port, as SW2\u0026#39;s G0/2\u0026nbsp;port is a root port. (Root ports expect to receive Hellos from the neighboring switch, but the switch does not forward Hellos out the root port.)\n\nAs for the two answers that mention a backup port,\u0026nbsp;none of the ports can\u0026nbsp;have a backup port role due to the current physical topology. To have a backup port with today\u0026#39;s Ethernet devices, one switch must connect more than one port to the same Ethernet segment, typically by connecting two ports to the same LAN hub. The figure shows no LAN hubs, so no ports can become backup ports.",

        "questionText":  "What is the purpose of using Root Guard?",
        "explanation":  "Root Guard is used to prevent unplanned switches from becoming the Root Bridge. Root Guard is configured on a port-by-port basis and listens to the BPDUs and determines whether the port receives a superior BPDU. If a superior BPDU is received, Root Guard prevents the election of a different root switch that is reachable through that port. Root Guard doesn\u0026rsquo;t forward superior BPDUs to another switch; it instead puts the port into what\u0026rsquo;s called \u0026ldquo;root-inconsistent\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;broken\u0026rdquo; state until no superior BPDUs are being received in the hellos. Then the port automatically recovers back to a functioning state. Inferior BPDUs have no impact on Root Guard or the operational state of the port.",

        "questionText":  "The exhibit shows a diagram of a small switched network. All switches use layer 2 switching and no layer 3 switching. The diagram identifies the root switch (switch SW1), and all root ports (RP) and designated ports (DP) for VLAN 10. All switches have the spanning-tree mode rapid-pvst command configured. The answers list ports that are neither root port nor designated port. Choose the answer that lists an RSTP port role that is meaningful for that port in this topology.",
        "explanation":  "The alternate port role acts as an alternate root port, while the backup port role serves as a backup designated port for a designated port on the same switch.\n\n\tFirst, for the answers that mention \u0026ldquo;backup port,\u0026rdquo; note that for a port to act as backup port, it must back up a designated port on that same switch. Also, that backup port must connect to the same collision domain. The collision domains include all the point-to-point links between switches and the links connected to the one LAN hub. Based on these facts, neither SW3 nor SW2 can have a backup port, because each does not connect with two ports to the same collision domain. However, switch SW4 does connect with two ports to the same collision domain (as created by the hub), so SW4 could use port F0/2 as an RSTP backup port.\n\n\tFor the alternate port concept, each nonroot switch can have an alternate (root) port. The alternate cannot also be serving in the designated port role or already be serving in the root port role. Based on those rules, SW3\u0026#39;s F0/4 and SW4\u0026#39;s G0/1 could both be the alternate port. (SW2\u0026rsquo;s port G0/2 could be an alternate port as well, but it is not listed as an answer.)\u0026nbsp;",

The two incorrect answer list settings that would not cause issues. First, the channel-group number is locally significant, that is, switch 1 can use group 1 for all its links, with switch 2 using another number for all its links.

        "explanation":  "Access ports strip all VLAN information before the frame egresses the destination interface. The endpoint on an access switch port will never see any of the VLAN information that was associated with the frame. A trunk port will carry the frame along with the VLAN information until it gets to the other side of the trunk link. Voice ports also carry the frame along with VLAN tagging information. A Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP) port will form a trunk port to another switch; therefore, it is a trunking protocol, not a switchport type.",

When a switch is set to auto for the Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP), it will respond to trunking requests but will not initiate DTP messages. The adjacent switch must be set to desirable since the desirable mode will send DTP messages. The native VLAN does not show it has been changed, since VLAN 1 is the default native VLAN as it is configured in the figure. The figure does not show evidence that the switch is sending DTP frames. Evidence also does not exist in the figure to support the theory that the adjacent switch is also set for auto DTP.",

        "explanation":  "Loop Guard is used to prevent higher (poor) priority switches from moving their alternate or blocking ports to a forwarding state in the event of a unidirectional link failure. This typically occurs with fiber optic cable failures. This is when the device can\u0026rsquo;t detect the fiber failure and attempts to forward traffic down a link that can only send or receive traffic due to the broken fiber cable. When a Loop Guard\u0026ndash;enabled port stops receiving BPDUs from its upstream neighbor for a certain period, it places the port into a \u0026ldquo;loop-inconsistent\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;broken\u0026rdquo; state. The port stops forwarding traffic until it begins receiving BPDUs again from its upstream neighbor. This prevents the port from transitioning to the forwarding state due to a lack of BPDUs, which could lead to a forwarding loop if the network topology has changed. Designated and alternate ports cannot by definition become a root port.",

There are 4 switches, and each non-root switch must have 1 root port, so there are 3 root ports. Each link must have one designated port, so there are 6 designated ports. The remaining ports are alternate ports - they enter the discarding state to prevent loops. So, there are 3 alternate ports. There are no backup ports; hubs are extremely rare in modern networks, and no hubs are mentioned in the question.",

        "explanation":  "You should designate Switch A for VLAN 10 and Switch B for VLAN 20. The STP root bridge for a particular VLAN should be placed as close as possible to the center of the VLAN. If the majority of network traffic is between the hosts and servers within each VLAN, and the servers are grouped into a server farm, then the switch that all hosts will be sending their data to is the ideal choice for the STP root. Cisco?s default implementation of STP is called Per-VLAN Spanning Tree (or PVST), which allows individual tuning of the spanning tree within each VLAN. Switch A can be configured as the root bridge for VLAN 10, and Switch B can be configured as the root bridge for VLAN 20, resulting in optimized traffic flow for both.",

All ports on the root bridge will become designated ports in a forwarding state. Switch B has redundant connectivity to the root bridge, and must block one of its interfaces to prevent a switching loop. Both interfaces are the same speed (FastEthernet), and thus their cost to the root is the same. Finally, the interface with the lowest number will become the forwarding port. F0/1 has a lower port number than F0/2, so F0/1 becomes a forwarding port, and F0/2 becomes a blocking port.",

The alternative port will surely belong to Switch4.\nSwitch4 will need to block one of its ports to avoid a bridging loop between the two switches. But how does Switch4 select its blocked port? Well, the answer is based on the BPDUs it receives from Switch3. A BPDU is superior to another if it has:",

You can create different logical topologies by using the VLANs on your network to ensure that all of your links are used but that no one link is oversubscribed. Each instance of PVST+ on a VLAN has a single root switch. This root switch propagates the spanning-tree information associated with that VLAN to all other switches in the network. Because each switch has the same information about the network, this process ensures that the network topology is maintained and optimized per VLAN.\nReference: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/switches/lan/catalyst3750x_3560x/software/release/12.2_55_se/configuration/guide/swstp.html",

Switch C has lowest MAC address so it will become root bridge and 2 of its ports (Fa0/1 \u0026 Fa0/2) will be designated ports.\nBecause SwitchC is the root bridge so the 2 ports nearest SwitchC on SwitchA (Fa0/1) and SwitchD (Gi0/2) will be root ports.\nNow we come to the most difficult part of this question: SwitchB must have a root port so which port will it choose? To answer this question we need to know about STP cost and port cost.\nIn general, ?cost? is calculated based on bandwidth of the link. The higher the bandwidth on a link, the lower the value of its cost. Below are the cost values you should memorize:",

        "explanation":  "One big disadvantage of STP is the low convergence which is very important in switched network. To overcome this problem, in 2001, the IEEE with document 802.1w introduced an evolution of the Spanning Tree Protocol: Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP), which significantly reduces the convergence time after a topology change occurs in the network. While STP can take 30 to 50 seconds to transit from a blocking state to a forwarding state, RSTP is typically able to respond less than 10 seconds of a physical link failure.",

The three switches in the figure all have the default priority, so we should compare the MAC address, it is easy to find that SwitchB is the root bridge.\n2. Select the root port on the non-root bridge, which can be completed through comparing root path cost. The smallest will be selected as the root port.\n3. Next, select the Designated Port. First, compare the path cost, if the costs happen to be the same, then compare the BID, still the smallest will be selected. Each link has a DP. Based on the exhibit above, we can find DP on each link. The DP on the link between SwitchA and SwitchC is SwitchA?Fa0/1, because it has the smallest MAC address.",

        "explanation":  "The root bridge of the spanning tree is the bridge with the smallest (lowest) bridge ID. Each bridge has a configurable priority number and a MAC Address; the bridge ID contains both numbers combined together ? Bridge priority + MAC (32768.0200.0000.1111). The Bridge priority default is 32768 and can only be configured in multiples of 4096 (Spanning tree uses the 12 bits extended system ID). To compare two bridge IDs, the priority is compared first, as if looking at a real number anything less than 32768\u0085will become the target of being the root. If two bridges have equal priority then the MAC addresses are compared; for example, if switches A (MAC=0200.0000.1111) and B (MAC=0200.0000.2222) both have a priority of 32768 then switch A will be selected as the root bridge.\nIn this case, 32768: 11-22-33-44-55-66 would be the bridge because it has a lower priority and MAC address.",

        "explanation":  "In a VLAN environment, for hosts in the same VLAN to communicate across multiple switches, the VLAN must exist and be active on *all* switches along the path, and the interconnecting links must be configured as trunks allowing that VLAN.\n\nGiven that the trunk port is configured, the most likely cause for hosts in VLAN 10 on Switch1 not being able to ping hosts in VLAN 10 on Switch2 is that **VLAN 10 is not created on Switch2**.\n\n- If VLAN 10 doesn\u0027t exist on Switch2, any frames tagged with VLAN 10 arriving on the trunk will be dropped by Switch2 as it doesn\u0027t recognize that VLAN ID.\n- Other options are less likely:\n    - If the trunk allowed only VLAN 20, VLAN 10 traffic wouldn\u0027t pass, but the question implies a working trunk.\n    - If the trunk was an access port, it wouldn\u0027t carry multiple VLANs.\n    - Spanning Tree blocking the port would prevent all traffic, not just specific VLAN traffic.",

        "explanation":  "EtherChannel bundles multiple physical links into one logical link, and it employs load balancing to distribute traffic across these member links. \n\nCisco EtherChannel most commonly uses **source and destination IP address hashing** to distribute traffic (Option B).\n\n- This method takes the source and destination IP addresses from the packet\u0027s header.\n- It then uses a hashing algorithm to compute a value that determines which specific physical link in the EtherChannel bundle will carry that packet.\n- This ensures that all packets belonging to the same conversation (same source/destination IP pair) consistently use the same physical link, which prevents out-of-order packet delivery and ensures proper reassembly.\n\n- Round Robin and Source MAC address hashing are less common or less effective for typical IP traffic distribution in EtherChannel.",

        "questionText":  "The figure shows a typical basic network, with servers, PCs, layer 2 LAN switches, and IP routers. PC1 has opened a web browser to connect to web server S1. In response to a request for a web page, the server sends 1000 TCP segments to PC1. All 1000 TCP segments arrive at PC1 with no problems. However, the window size used on this TCP connection started small and then grew over time while those 1000 TCP segments were being sent. What happens to grow the window size?",
        "explanation":  "The key to answering this question revolves around the following key concepts:\n\n\t\n\t\tIn each TCP connection, two independent windowing mechanisms exist: a window of data for sending data from one host to the other, and vice versa. That is, host 1 can send X data to host 2, and host 2 can send Y data to host 1, with X and Y being the two independent windows.\n\t\n\t\tThe receiving host chooses the size of the window; the sending host does not choose the size of the window.\n\t\n\t\tThe receiving host informs the sending host of the current allowed window size by listing the window size in the Window field in the TCP header.\n\n\n\tWith these facts in mind, in this case, PC1 would need to send a TCP segment to server S1. That segment lists the Window field. That value represents the number of bytes server S1 can send for its next window of data for this TCP connection.\n\n\tFor the incorrect answers, two of those refer to PC1 and setting values in a TCP segment sent to server S1. While the general mechanism is correct, those answers refer to fields used for acknowledging data and performing error recovery, rather than managing the size of the window.\n\n\tThe two other answers suggest that the server chooses how large a window to use when sending data. With TCP, the sender does not choose the window size; instead, the sender is granted or given the right to send a window of data as specified by the receiving host, as described earlier.",

To perform TCP error recovery, TCP creates a connection before sending any data, with part of that process establishing sequence and acknowledgement numbers used in the error recovery process.

R1 is intended to be the primary time source for R2, and R2 is the primary time source for R3. Which Cisco IOS command would be required to configure R1 into this role using a stratum level of 2?",
        "explanation":  "A few different commands are typically used to configure basic NTP; they include the ntp server, ntp peer, and the ntp master commands. The ntp server command indicates that a device intends to get its time from the configured server but is unwilling to give it to that server (it can, however, give time to other devices, as long as its primary source is active). The ntp peer command indicates that a device intends to get its time from the configured peer and is willing to give its time to that peer should that peer lose its primary clock source (this is usually configured as a backup configuration). The ntp master command configures a device as an authoritative clock source. This command is usually used along with the ntp server command on core devices to ensure that if the core device loses its primary clock source (as configured with the ntp server command), it can still offer an authoritative clock source to other devices that use it as their primary clock source. In this scenario, R1 would need to be configured with the ntp master 2 command to allow other devices to use it as their time source.",

The goal: disable CDP on the upper link (G1/0/1) and enable it for all others. The engineer creates four solutions they can copy/paste into global configuration mode. Which answer achieves the CDP configuration goal and will not result in any IOS messages about invalid commands?",
        "explanation":  "In this specific case, you can achieve the stated goal by enabling CDP by default so that any interface with a subcommand to change the setting will use CDP. Then, you combine that with the interface subcommand that disables CDP on that specific interface, overriding the default. In summary, the question asks to enable CDP on all interfaces but to override that setting for interface G1/0/1.\n\nCDP and LLDP use the same conventions with the run and enable keywords in the commands to enable/disable the protocols. Cisco chose the run keyword for the global commands and enable for the interface subcommands. As a result, the correct config is:\n\n\ncdp run                      ! Global command, default CDP on\ninterface GigabitEthernet 1/0/1\n  no cdp enable              ! Interface subcommand to override default\n\n\n\nTwo incorrect answers begin with a\u0026nbsp;cdp enable\u0026nbsp;command. The question describes a process of pasting the configuration into global config mode. However, IOS would reject the cdp enable command in this mode because it is not a valid IOS global command.\n\nThe other incorrect answer lists the no cdp run command after the interface G1/0/1 command. Even though in interface configuration mode, the IOS recognizes and accepts this valid global command - disabling CDP on all interfaces.",

If the command lists no directory, it uses the directory per the present working directory environment variable, as seen by the pwd EXEC command. Given the facts for this question, the dir command (without a directory parameter) lists files in the bootflash: base directory, while\u0026nbsp;the dir bootflash:/backups\u0026nbsp;command lists files in the /backups subdirectory. Also, note that the dir command lists files in the specific directory but does not list the files found in subdirectories.\n\nNext, consider the sequence of events with the three commands issued by the engineer. Both copy commands list the second filename with no directory and just the filename (backup1.txt and backup2.txt). As a result, these copy commands copy the file into the present working directory. Given that the user did not change their pwd using the pwd command, both commands copy files into the pwd, namely bootflash: As a result, both files reside in the bootflash: directory in this scenario.",

        "explanation":  "Multigig Ethernet introduced two new speeds: 2.5 Gbps and 5.0 Gbps. Before introducing multigig in the mid-2010s, the IEEE had released 1000BASE-T (late 1990s) and 10GBASE-T (mid-2000s). The popular 1000BASE-T standard required Cat 5E cabling, and many building owners deployed Cat 5E from wiring closets to locations on each floor. 10GBASE-T requires Cat 6A cabling to reach distances up to 100 meters\u0026mdash;that requirement forced building owners to consider upgrading the Ethernet cabling plant at some expense.\n\nThe IEEE engineered two new Ethernet speeds between 1 Gbps and 10 Gbps that work over the same cabling as 1000BASE-T (Cat 5E) at the same 100-meter distance. Those speeds are 2.5 and 5.0 Gbps. As for the incorrect answers, the IEEE has standards for 10 Gbps using UTP cabling (10GBASE-T). To date, the IEEE does not have UTP-based standards for 2 and 20 Gbps.",

        "explanation":  "To review the terms, PD represents Powered Device, referring to the device that needs power. PSE means Power Sourcing Equipment, referring to the switch that supplies power to the PD over the Ethernet cable.\n\nThe question asks about automatic detection for the initial power levels. That process uses the sensing of electrical signals. The PSE and PD create a circuit, with the PSE inducing a current on the circuit. The PD changes the signal by applying a specific amount of resistance. The returning signal, reduced by the electrical resistance applied by the PD, signals to the PSE that a PD exists. Knowing a PD exists, the PSE can supply a small initial current, just enough to allow the PD to initialize enough software to ask for additional power via layer two messages using CDP and LLDP.",

The popular 1000BASE-T standard required Cat 5E cabling, and many building owners deployed Cat 5E from wiring closets to locations on each floor. 10GBASE-T requires Cat 6A cabling to reach distances up to 100 meters\u0026mdash;that requirement forced building owners to consider upgrading the Ethernet cabling plant at some expense.\n\nThe IEEE engineered two new Ethernet speeds between 1 Gbps and 10 Gbps that work over the same cabling as 1000BASE-T (Cat 5E) at the same 100-meter distance. Those speeds are 2.5 and 5.0 Gbps. As for the incorrect answers, the IEEE has standards for 10 Gbps using UTP cabling (10GBASE-T).

The core layer aggregates the distribution layer switches and provides a very high speed connection.

The VPN remains up and working under normal conditions. The endpoint hosts have no awareness of the existence of the VPN, with IP routing forwarding packets over the VPN and the VPN features encrypting the data. All devices at a site can send traffic over the site-to-site VPN. The two incorrect answers refer to attributes of site-to-site VPNs.\n\nRemote access VPNs support a single device. Sometimes, the host uses VPN client software to create an encrypted VPN connection to a remote site. For instance, a remote worker can use a VPN client on their laptop to create a secure VPN tunnel to the corporate network over the Internet. That VPN supports all packets sent by that one host but not for other hosts at the site. The user at that host can connect with the VPN software, use the connection, and stop it later as needed, as an on-demand service.",

A site-to-site VPN creates one tunnel, configured on two devices, one at each location. Once the tunnel is functional, all devices at each site can communicate with devices in the other site.\n\nThe remote access VPN options using either IPsec or TLS would not be best given the design. Both\u0026nbsp;require each device to create their own VPN tunnel to each other device. Doing so in this case would require extra unnecessary work and would be difficult to scale and manage long term.\n\nThe other incorrect answer, MPLS VPN, uses a private WAN (MPLS) rather than the Internet, so it does not meet the requirements listed in the question.",

        "questionText":  "Which statements are most accurate about using IPsec tunnel mode instead of transport mode? (Choose two answers.)",
        "explanation":  "IPsec tunnel mode refers to the scope of encryption. With tunnel mode, the VPN endpoints receive packets created by other hosts. After receiving a packet, if the routing choice directs the packet over the VPN tunnel, the sender encrypts the original unencrypted IP packet. The sender creates a new IP packet with a new IP header. The source and destination of the new packet use the VPN tunnel devices\u0026rsquo; addresses as the source and destination of the packet. The original encrypted packet resides as data in the new packet. Once the receiving tunnel endpoint receives the packet, it extracts the data, which holds the encrypted original IP packet, and decrypts it.\n\nTunnel mode works well for site-to-site VPNs. Site-to-site VPNs must support traffic from many hosts with different IP addresses. Encrypting and later decrypting the original IP packet preserves the original source and destination IP addresses, making it easy to forward the packets after they exit the VPN tunnel.\n\nThe two incorrect answers describe IPsec transport mode. It works well for remote access VPNs for which one VPN connection supports, at most, a single host. One site has only one IP address to serve, implied as one of the tunnel endpoints. So, transport mode, which uses fewer overhead bytes, works well for IPsec remote access VPNs.",

        "explanation":  "A site-to-site VPN connects two sites by creating a tunnel between two IT-controlled devices (routers, firewalls, or network access servers.) The VPN remains up and working under normal conditions. The endpoint hosts have no awareness of the existence of the VPN, with IP routing forwarding packets over the VPN and the VPN features encrypting the data. All devices at a site can send traffic over the site-to-site VPN. The two incorrect answers refer to attributes of site-to-site VPNs.\n\nRemote access VPNs support a single device. Sometimes, the host uses VPN client software to create an encrypted VPN connection to a remote site. For instance, a remote worker can use a VPN client on their laptop to create a secure VPN tunnel to the corporate network over the Internet. That VPN supports all packets sent by that one host but not for other hosts at the site. The user at that host can connect with the VPN software, use the connection, and stop it later as needed, as an on-demand service.",

        "explanation":  "In a controller-based network architecture, the controller has its own responsibilities, which align with the duties of common control plane networking protocols like EIGRP, OSPF, and ARP or processes like MAC learning. The controller then uses this information to control the deployed devices via the Southbound Interface (SBI); but the controllers themselves need to be configured as well. This can happen using direct access to the controller or through a number of application programming interfaces (API). These APIs can then be used (via an application) to control how the network forwards the traffic; this interface into the controllers is referred to as the Northbound Interface (NBI).",

        "explanation":  "The IEEE defines the format and assignment of LAN addresses. The IEEE requires globally unique unicast MAC addresses on all LAN interface cards. To ensure a unique MAC address, the Ethernet card manufacturers encode the MAC address onto the card. The first half of the address identifies the manufacturer of the card. Each manufacturer assigns a MAC address with its own OUI as the first half of the address, with the second half of the address being assigned a number that this manufacturer has never used on another card.The timer \u0026ldquo;(min)\u0026rdquo; indicates how long ago the MAC address was learned or updated. A timers of \u0026ldquo;-\u0026ldquo; means that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t dynamically learned and usually represents the device\u0026rsquo;s own MAC address. A hardware address is 48 bits long, is a Layer 2 address, and is represented in 12 hexadecimal characters (with each representing 4 bits).",

        "explanation":  "When a router processes an incoming packet, the router de-encapsulates the packet from the data link frame and then re-encapsulates the packet in a new data link frame before forwarding the new frame. The reason is the changing data link layer addresses and/or interface technologies (Ethernet versus HDLC).\u0026nbsp;\n\n\tIn this case, the question asks how many times the packet will be encapsulated. Note that the packet begins within R1, not from a host outside R1. So, the IP packet will first be encapsulated on R1. From here, it will be sent to R2, which will de-encapsulate the packet from the Ethernet frame and re-encapsulate the IP packet into another Ethernet frame. From here, R3 will de-encapsulate the packet from the Ethernet frame and re-encapsulate the IP packet into an HDLC frame. From here, R4 will de-encapsulate the packet from the HDLC frame and re-encapsulate the IP packet into an Ethernet frame. From there, the frame holding that packet will arrive at R5, which will de-encapsulate the packet from the Ethernet frame and process it. However, R5 will not encapsulate the packet for forwarding again, as R5 is the destination.\n\n\t\u0026nbsp;\n\n\tSo to add them up: R1 (encapsulate), R2 (de-encapsulate/re-encapsulate), R3 (de-encapsulate/re-encapsulate), R4 (de-encapsulate/re-encapsulate) = 4.",

The router does not check the layer 3 source IP address or the layer 2 destination MAC address when making its forwarding decision.",

        "explanation":  "Five specific criteria are required for a service to be a cloud service:\n\n\t\n\t\tOn-demand self-service: You determine when you want and do not want a service.\n\t\n\t\tBroad network access: The cloud service must be accessible by numerous connectivity options and a fast number of devices should be able to leverage it.\n\t\n\t\tResource pooling: Instead of assigning dedicated resources, such as memory and CPU, to each system, resources can be shared across a set of services, servers, and systems. These shared resources are then dynamically allocated on-demand as a system needs it.\n\t\n\t\tRapid elasticity: A cloud service is very different than an on-premise virtual environment. There are still capabilities like resource pooling on-premise, but with rapid elasticity it\u0026rsquo;s hard to come by. Rapid elasticity makes the pools of resources seem unlimited. New resource requests are completed rapidly.\n\t\n\t\tMeasured service: In a cloud service, utilization is tracked and monitored, which can then be reported on by the operator. This is used for billing but also can be used for other capabilities if needed by an organization.\n\n\n\tBoth agile network access and proactive service are unrelated to a cloud service offering and refer to business architecture principals.",

A full-mesh topology is often found between the core and distribution layers of the Cisco three-tier design model. A partial-mesh topology is often found between the distribution and access layers in the Cisco three-tier design model. A hybrid topology is found in many networks today because one topology does not fit all needs throughout the network.",

        "explanation":  "Bandwidth is the primary decision factor for moving the Domain Name System (DNS) closer to the application in the public cloud. However, if the majority of DNS users are on premises, then it should remain on premises for bandwidth reasons. Response time should not increase, since DNS is a lightweight service for looking up resource records. DNS resolution should not be affected when migrating DNS to a public cloud. Although the cloud provider has certain requirements, DNS functionality is relatively the same.",

User Datagram Protocol (UDP) operates at the Transport layer, but UDP does not provide flow control for communications. UDP provides a program with a connectionless method of transmitting segments. The Internet Protocol (IP) is logical addressing for the routing of information. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a connection-based protocol and maintains a state throughout the transfer of data.

Switches cannot perform error correction from the CRC calculation; they can only detect that there are errors and discard the frame. Switches will never send a frame back; they will discard the frame and wait for retransmission from upper-layer protocols. Switches do not store frames for longer than it would take for a forward filter decision to be made.",

        "explanation":  "A router will stop broadcasts by default. If you add a router to a flat network, which is a single broadcast domain, you effectively raise bandwidth by reducing the number of broadcasts. A firewall is a network device that can protect a network from malicious traffic and/or restrict access. A hub is nothing more than a multiport repeater and does not create broadcast domains. A switch is a layer 2 device that creates microsegmentation.",

        "explanation":  "Generally, office buildings do not have direct runs to each switch closet from the other closets. Although a full mesh is desirable, sometimes only a partial mesh is achievable. Traditional Ethernet-based networks function in a star topology, starting with a switch and connecting each client as a point on the star. A full-mesh topology is often found between the core and distribution layers of the Cisco three-tier design model. A hybrid topology is found in many networks today because one topology does not fit all needs throughout the network.",

        "explanation":  "Rapid elasticity is the ability to add and remove compute capability in the cloud. As demand increases, compute power can be increased by adding more CPUs or servers. As demand for compute power decreases, CPUs or servers can be removed. Resource pooling is the concept that all of the physical hosts the provider has are pooled together to provide a customer with resources. Measured services is the concept that the provider can determine the amount of computing, network, or storage a customer has used so that they can be billed or a report can be created. Broad network access is the concept that the resources can be accessed from anywhere on the Internet.",

JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is used for input and output of data; although it can be used in conjunction with a script, it by itself is not a script language. You cannot apply YAML or JSON templates to routers unless there is another mechanism, such as a script, that is being used.",

        "explanation":  "Basically, a collision domain is a network segment that allows normal network traffic to flow back and forth. In the old days of hubs, this meant you had a lot of collisions, and the old CSMA/CD would be working overtime to try to get those packets re-sent every time there was a collision on the wire (since Ethernet allows only one host to be transmitting at once without there being a traffic jam). With switches, you break up collision domains by switching packets bound for other collision domains. These days, since we mostly use switches to connect computers to the network, you generally have one collision domain to a PC.\nBroadcast domains are exactly what they imply: they are network segments that allow broadcasts to be sent across them. Since switches and bridges allow for broadcast traffic to go unswitched, broadcasts can traverse collision domains freely. Routers, however, don t allow broadcasts through by default, so when a broadcast hits a router (or the perimeter of a VLAN), it doesn t get forwarded. The simple way to look at it is this way: switches break up collision domains, while routers (and VLANs) break up collision domains and broadcast domains. Also, a broadcast domain can contain multiple collision domains, but a collision domain can never have more than one broadcast domain associated with it.\nCollision Domain: A group of Ethernet or Fast Ethernet devices in a CSMA/CD LAN that are connected by repeaters and compete for access on the network. Only one device in the collision domain may transmit at any one time, and the other devices in the domain listen to the network in order to avoid data collisions. A collision domain is sometimes referred to as an Ethernet segment.\nBroadcast Domain: Broadcasting sends a message to everyone on the local network (subnet). An example for Broadcasting would be DHCP Request from a Client PC. The Client is asking for a IP Address, but the client does not know how to reach the DHCP Server. So the client sends a DHCP Discover packet to EVERY PC in the local subnet (Broadcast). But only the DHCP Server will answer to the Request.\nHow to count them?\nBroadcast Domain:\nNo matter how many hosts or devices are connected together, if they are connected with a repeater, hub, switch or bridge, all these devices are in ONE Broadcast domain (assuming a single VLAN). A Router is used to separate Broadcast-Domains (we could also call them Subnets   or call them VLANs). So, if a router stands between all these devices, we have TWO broadcast domains.\nCollision Domain:\nEach connection from a single PC to a Layer 2 switch is ONE Collision domain. For example, if 5 PCs are connected with separate cables to a switch, we have 5 Collision domains. If this switch is connected to another switch or a router, we have one collision domain more.\nIf 5 Devices are connected to a Hub, this is ONE Collision Domain. Each device that is connected to a Layer 1 device (repeater, hub) will reside in ONE single collision domain.",

For example in the topology above, pings to S0/1 and S0/0 of Router 2 have the same TTL.\nThe picture below shows TTL values for each interface of each router and for Host B.

So we can deduce the ip address (of the serial interface) of Manchester router is 10.1.1.1.\nThe platform of the neighbor router is cisco 2610, as shown in the output.\nMaybe the most difficult choice of this question is the answer E or F.

        "explanation":  "This question assesses the fundamental differences between TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol), both Transport Layer protocols.\n\n**TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): Connection-Oriented and Reliable**\n- **Connection-Oriented:** Establishes a dedicated, virtual connection using a three-way handshake before data transmission.\n- **Reliable Data Delivery:** Ensures data integrity and order through mechanisms like segment numbering, acknowledgements (ACKs), retransmissions for lost data, flow control (windowing), and congestion control. It\u0027s suitable for applications where data accuracy is paramount (e.g., web browsing, email, file transfer).\n\n**UDP (User Datagram Protocol): Connectionless and Unreliable**\n- **Connectionless:** Sends data datagrams without establishing a prior connection or handshake.\n- **Unreliable Data Delivery:** Provides a \"best-effort\" delivery service with minimal overhead. It does not guarantee delivery, order, or error correction at the protocol level. It\u0027s suitable for applications where speed and low latency are more critical than guaranteed delivery (e.g., streaming media, online gaming, VoIP, DNS queries).\n\nTherefore, **Option C** correctly states that TCP is connection-oriented and reliable, while UDP is connectionless and unreliable.",

Used for applications requiring high data integrity (e.g., HTTP, FTP, SSH).\n\n- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol):** Connectionless and unreliable, providing best-effort delivery with lower overhead.

Authentication protects network access but does not protect privacy. The MIC function protects data integrity so that it cannot be altered without detection, but it does not affect data privacy. DPP does not affect data privacy because it is a fictitious mechanism.",

        "explanation":  "For the purposes of the CCENT and CCNA exams, the address specified in the statement (in the question) is assumed to be the correct subnet number (thus the lowest available address in the matched IP range). That said, to convert a wildcard mask back to a subnet mask, use the following technique: Take 255 and subtract the wildcard mask octet value. The first and second wildcard octets is 0, 255 \u0026ndash; 0 = 255. The third wildcard octet is 31, 255 \u0026ndash; 31 = 224. The fourth wildcard octet is 255, 255-255 = 0. This gives you a subnet mask of 255.255.224.0. The range of addresses can be found by taking the wildcard mask and adding it to the original network number configured. This will give you the highest range address; 192 + 0 = 192, 30 + 0 = 30, 32 + 31 = 63, 0 + 255 = 255. This makes the lowest number in the range 192.30.32.0 and the highest number 192.30.63.255.",

The show ip interface command output lists those two ACLs on separate consecutive lines. Alternately, suppose the configuration uses the ip access-group\u0026hellip; out interface subcommand, which omits the common keyword. In that case, it defines a normal ACL for that direction \u0026ndash; and informs the router not to use a common ACL.\n\nIf no ip access-group command exists under the interface for a given direction, both output lines list \u0026ldquo;not set\u0026rdquo; at the end of the output lines.\n\nIn this question, the output lists ACL names on all four lines, revealing that the configuration commands for both directions use the common keyword.

        "explanation":  "The web servers reside on the left side of the figure in subnet 172.16.10.0/24. Calculate the wildcard mask based on the DDN mask to match addresses in that subnet. First, /24 converts to DDN mask 255.255.255.0. Subtract that value from 255.255.255.255 to find the wildcard mask:\n\n255.255.255.255 \u0026ndash; 255.255.255.0 = 0.0.0.255\n\nAll the ACEs use the correct subnet ID and wildcard mask for this question. They also all use the any keyword as the destination address. Given the location as an outbound ACL on R1\u0026#39;s G0/0/1 interface, the ACL attempts to match the correct packets: those sourced by the web servers in subnet 172.16.10.0/24\u0026nbsp;and destined for any other address.\n\nAs for matching web traffic, you need to be aware of HTTP versions, the transport protocol used by each, and the default well-known ports. They include:\n\n\n\tHTTP 1.0, 1.1, and 2.0, which use TCP and default well-known server TCP port 80 when not using Secure HTTP\n\tHTTP 1.0, 1.1, and 2.0, which use TCP and default well-known server TCP port 443 when also using TLS and Secure HTTP\n\tHTTP 3.0, which uses UDP, TLS, and QUIC, and default well-known UDP port 443\n\n\nIn this case, the question asks about HTTP 1.1 with TLS. The ACE must match TCP (the correct transport protocol) and well-known TCP port 443 to match those packets. Note that all the ACEs place the well-known port in the source port location in the command because the ACL matches packets sent by the server. As a result:\n\n\n\tACE 10 does not match due to the udp keyword.\n\tACE 12 does match, due to: TCP, using the correct source and destination address values, with source port 443.\n\n\nThe router will not attempt to match later ACEs because IOS ACLs use first-match logic.",

Alternatively, using the same configuration process IOS supports for named ACLs to configure numbered ACLs. That process supports ACL configuration mode and line numbers, allowing you to remove one line in the ACL. To do so, once in ACL configuration mode for the ACL, the no line-number command deletes one line of the ACL.",

        "explanation":  "When converting a numbered ACL to a named ACL, it first must be determined which type of ACL is being converted. In this case, because the number used is 150, it is an extended ACL. This is then used to perform the initial creation of the ACL with the ip access-list extended name command; this will enter the user into extended named ACL configuration mode. The commands from here are very similar to those used with a numbered list but without the access-list and the ACL number at the beginning of the statement. For example, access-list 150 deny udp 172.16.1.0 0.0.0.255 host 10.1.2.3 eq tftp becomes deny udp 172.16.1.0 0.0.0.255 host 10.1.2.3 eq tftp.",

        "explanation":  "The question states that the output comes from a command in a router so that you can rely on the access control entries (ACEs) having correct syntax. You can also expect that for the address and wildcard pairs, the address represents the lowest number in a range, with the highest number found by adding the address and wildcard mask. For instance, 10.22.33.0 + 0.0.0.63, added octet-by-octet, gives you 10.22.33.63. The source addresses in the ACL define these ranges, all of which include the source address 10.22.33.30 in the question.\n\n\n\tLine 10: 10.22.33.0 \u0026ndash; 10.22.33.63\n\tLine 20: 10.22.33.0 \u0026ndash; 10.22.33.127\n\tLine 30: 10.22.33.0 \u0026ndash; 10.22.33.31\n\tLine 40: 10.22.33.0 \u0026ndash; 10.22.33.255\n\n\nFrom that analysis, you can see that lines 20 and 40 emcompass the range of source addresses in the question stem, ruling out lines 10 and 30 as possible correct answers.\n\n\n\n\nFor ACEs 20 and 40, line 20 matches the SSH well-known port 22 as the source port, not the destination port, so its logic cannot match packets destined to an SSH server. Line 40 works because it matches the source and destination addresses per the question and also matches SSH as the destination port, port 22.",

The goal is to permit all traffic from any source address destined for web servers in the new data center subnet 10.10.48.0/20. Your ACEs should match web traffic that uses all HTTP versions\u0026nbsp;with\u0026nbsp;the servers using\u0026nbsp;default port numbers. Which answers list one of the ACEs? (Choose three answers.)",
        "explanation":  "The question asks for ACEs that support all HTTP versions. That includes:\n\n\n\tHTTP 1.0, 1.1, and 2.0, which use TCP and default well-known server TCP port 80 when not using Secure HTTP\n\tHTTP 1.0, 1.1, and 2.0, which use TCP, with the default well-known server TCP port 443 when also using\u0026nbsp;TLS (Secure HTTP).\n\tHTTP 3.0, which uses UDP, TLS, and QUIC, and default well-known UDP port 443\n\n\nAdditionally, to match the addresses in subnet 10.10.48.0/20, calculate the wildcard mask based on the DDN mask. First, /20 converts to DDN mask 255.255.240.0. Subtract that value from 255.255.255.255 to find the wildcard mask:\n\n255.255.255.255 \u0026ndash; 255.255.240.0 = 0.0.15.255\n\nThe correct answers all match the source address with the any keyword. They match the destination address with the combined subnet ID and wildcard mask of 10.10.48.0 0.0.15.255. The three correct answers then match TCP destination port 80 (for HTTP 1.0 traffic), TCP destination port 443 (for HTTP\u0026nbsp;1.1 and 2.0 traffic with TLS), and UDP destination port 443 (for HTTP 3.0 traffic.)",

        "explanation":  "Cisco IOS has long supported one IP ACL, per interface, per direction (in or out). For example, the ip access-group acl_01 out and ip access-group acl_02 in commands can coexist on an interface because they use opposite directions. However, if at that point you also configured another command to enable an IP ACL in the same direction on that interface \u0026ndash; for instance, using the ip access-group acl_03 out command - it would replace the ip access-group 1 out command as the only outbound IP ACL on the interface.\n\n\nWith the IOS XE Common ACL feature, you can configure two IP ACLs per interface per direction. The command syntax changes to ip access-group common common-acl regular-acl in|out. IOS XE processes the ACLs as if it matches the common ACL first and then the regular ACL. As a result, the long-held rule of one IP ACL per interface per direction expands to two ACLs.",

Repeating an ip access-group command under the same interface for the same direction replaces any previous command for that same direction. So, the router accepts each command in succession, but it replaces the previous one. In effect, only the final ip access-group command remains in the configuration in this case.

        "explanation":  "Two answers mention ACLs on interfaces. For an ACL enabled on an interface, inbound ACLs can work. A router processes all incoming packets with an inbound ACL. However, a router does not process self-generated packets with any enabled outbound ACL, so outbound ACLs would not attempt to match SSH packets generated by the router. \n\nThe access-class command in vty mode enables an ACL to filter Telnet and SSH traffic in the router. Inbound, the ACL filters incoming SSH/Telnet connections from external clients \u0026ndash; the function described in the question. Outbound, the ACL filters traffic generated by a router CLI user who uses the telnet and ssh commands to connect out of the router CLI \u0026ndash; which is not the function described in the question.",

RFC 2865 defines the RADIUS protocol and the use of port 1812. Finally, comparing RADIUS and TACACS+, RADIUS has become more popular as a protocol for authenticating end users. TACACS+ has some authorization features that work well with networking devices, making it more popular for network device authentication.",

        "explanation":  "A stateful firewall has the capability to track historical information about traffic that has passed through it, to then make semi-intelligent decisions based on that historical information. With these capabilities, a stateful firewall is properly enabled to mitigate a DoS attack. For instance, if can monitor the number of TCP connections to each IP address over time, watching for volumes that seem out-of-range versus normal operation.\n\n\tA stateless firewall and router ACL do not have the mechanisms or capabilities to provide any sort of historical information about the traffic that has passed through the security function. While they can match individual packets, they cannot consider past packets and trends that can identify a DoS attack.\n\n\tA security zone is a security component of a firewall where a designation is determined. Normally there is an inside and outside security zone, and traffic can be segmented between these zones one way or another. For example, traffic initiated from the inside security zone can traverse through the outside security zone, but traffic initiated from the outside security zone cannot traverse the inside security zone without proper approval. A security zone does not mitigate a DoS attack.",

The final configuration item you need is how the switchport is going to act when the three-client threshold has been tripped.

        "explanation":  "To meet the requirements here, you need to enable DHCP Snooping globally and for the specific VLAN PC4 is on (VLAN 20), on SW2. You accomplish this with these commands: ip dhcp snooping and ip dhcp snooping vlan 20 on SW2. The ports all use a default setting of untrusted for DHCP Snooping, meaning that DHCP Snooping will prevent PC4 from becoming a DHCP server.\n\n\tAdditionally, to support normal DHCP operations, you need to change some ports to be trusted so that SW2 will not filter DHCP messages originally sent by the legitimate DHCP server. The server connectes to SW2\u0026#39;s Gi0/12 port, also in VLAN 20. To allow those server messages, SW2 also needs an\u0026nbsp;ip dhcp snooping trust\u0026nbsp;command on SW2\u0026#39;s port Gi0/12, which connects to the DHCP server.\u0026nbsp;",

I\u0026rsquo;m talking about beyond the depth of CCNA. Those two features can be tricky and subtle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\tThat said, in this question, keep this concept in mind: Which switch ports might receive messages sent by a legitimate DHCP server? In the topology shown, on SW2, the only legitimate DHCP server is on SW2\u0026rsquo;s G0/24, so that\u0026rsquo;s the only port that needs to be trusted. That other port you believe should be trusted, SW2\u0026rsquo;s G0/12, would not receive messages from a legit DHCP in the network shown.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\tNow, if other legit DHCP servers existed on the other side of that router, and just were not shown in the figure, then yes, you\u0026rsquo;d have a reason to trust that port.\u0026quot;\u003cbr /\u003e\n\t6/8 - query to Au\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\t3/1 - ok as-is, \u0026quot; A \u0026ldquo;rogue\u0026rdquo; DHCP server is not the normal intended DHCP server, but with the attacker running a DHCP server on some other device. As worded, the question is attempting to note that the rogue DHCP server is running on PC4. The device labelled \u0026ldquo;DHCP Server\u0026rdquo; is the normal DHCP server supported by the IT staff. At the core of the question then is this: How do we prevent the attacker\u0026rsquo;s rogue DHCP server, running on PC4, from causing problems?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\tTo answer your other question, the correct answer mentions interface G0/12 (the port connected to the legitimate DHCP server) because that port has some non-default configuration. Port G0/2, connected to the attacker PC4, uses the default setting of untrusted.2/4 - query to Au, 2/1 - Query to Au - fixed\u003c/p\u003e\n",

        "explanation":  "To meet the requirements here, you need to enable DHCP snooping globally for each VLAN on both switches. You accomplish this with these commands: ip dhcp snooping, ip dhcp snooping vlan 10, and ip dhcp snooping vlan 20 on both switches. Next, you need to trust the DHCP server uplink port on SW2 with ip dhcp snooping trust in port interface Gi0/12. Finally, you need to trust to the trunk link between SW1 and SW2 from SW1\u0026rsquo;s side of the connection so that DHCP messages sent by the server, arriving back at switch SW1, will not be filtered. You do this with the same command, ip dhcp snooping trust, but on SW1\u0026rsquo;s interface Gi0/24 interface.",

The show version shows a reboot, which could be due to loss of power and restoration of power, that occurred 1 day, 3 hours, and 24 minutes previous to when the user issued the show command, and that is when it reverted back to its original hostname.\n\nConfigurations may be saved to NVRAM, TFTP servers, and other destinations, but not to a configuration register.

        "explanation":  "The password for the vty lines uses a different syntax and must also be done in line configuration mode for the lines we want to change the password for.If we did change the enable password, and not used the enable secret command, the existing enable secret for going into privileged mode would still not have been changed because the enable secret wins over the enable password. The transport of Telnet is allowed on the vty lines, provided we have authentication set appropriately. The command enable password is not the correct syntax for the vty line password configuration.",

To do that, HTTP must be disabled by issuing the no ip http server command. To then enable HTTPS, use the ip http secure-server command. If you are using a local username and password to log in, you must tell the device to use the local username database on the device by issuing the ip http authentication local command.

Clients on the right side of the figure connect to the web servers on the left. All web servers use default well-known ports. When a client connects using HTTP/3, which ACE matches the packets?\n\n\nR1# show access-list Hannah\n\n  10 permit udp 172.16.10.0 0.0.0.255 eq 443 any\n  12 permit tcp 172.16.10.0 0.0.0.255 eq 443 any\n  20 permit tcp 172.16.10.0 0.0.0.255 eq 80 any\n  22 permit udp 172.16.10.0 0.0.0.255 eq 80 any\n\u0026hellip;",
        "explanation":  "First, note that all the ACEs match the correct source address range per the 172.16.10.0 0.0.0.255 parameters. Those parameters match the addresses in the server subnet. The ACEs all match any destination address using the any keyword. As a result, the question drills down on the other matching parameters.\n\nAs for matching web traffic, you need to be aware of HTTP versions, the transport protocol used by each, and the default well-known ports. They include:\n\n\n\tHTTP 1.0, 1.1, and 2.0, which use TCP and default well-known server TCP port 80 when not using Secure HTTP\n\tHTTP 1.0, 1.1, and 2.0, which use TCP and default well-known server TCP port 443 when also using TLS and Secure HTTP\n\tHTTP 3.0, which uses UDP, TLS, and QUIC, and default well-known UDP port 443\n\n\nIn this case, the question asks about HTTP/3. HTTP/3 uses only UDP (and not TCP) and uses\u0026nbsp;well-known UDP port 443 defined for QUIK to match those packets. HTTP/3 requires encryption, so HTTP/3 does not use well-known port 80. As for the ACEs, the correct ACE should match port 443 as the source port because the ACL\u0026#39;s location matches packets\u0026nbsp;sent by the server. As a result:\n\n\n\tACE 10 matches, due to: UDP, using the correct source and destination address values, with source port 443.\n\n\nThe router will not consider later ACEs because IOS ACLs use first-match logic, but none of the ACEs would match the packets anyway.",

An alternative to conventional access lists is named access lists. A named access list is referenced by line numbers, which allows for removal and addition of single entries. Unfortunately, the Cisco IOS does not provide an ACL editor for conventional access lists. You can remove the line number and add a new line number back when you use named access lists. However, this functionality is not available for conventional access lists. Conventional access lists can be completely negated with the no command, but you cannot negate a single entry.",

Therefore, switches have one or more switch virtual interfaces (SVIs). These are virtual interfaces because there is no physical hardware on the device associated with it. An SVI is created in software.\nThe virtual interface lets you remotely manage a switch over a network using IPv4 and IPv6. Each switch comes with one SVI appearing in the default configuration  out-of-the-box.  The default SVI is interface VLAN1.",

        "explanation":  "The configuration shown here is an example of port security, specifically port security using sticky addresses. You can use port security with dynamically learned and static MAC addresses to restrict a port s ingress traffic by limiting the MAC addresses that are allowed to send traffic into the port. When you assign secure MAC addresses to a secure port, the port does not forward ingress traffic that has source addresses outside the group of defined addresses. If you limit the number of secure MAC addresses to one and assign a single secure MAC address, the device attached to that port has the full bandwidth of the port.\nPort security with sticky MAC addresses provides many of the same benefits as port security with static MAC addresses, but sticky MAC addresses can be learned dynamically.\nPort security with sticky MAC addresses retains dynamically learned MAC addresses during a link-down condition.",

        "explanation":  "A TRAP is a SNMP message sent from one application to another (which is typically on a remote host). Their purpose is merely to notify the other application that something has happened, has been noticed, etc. The big problem with TRAPs is that they re unacknowledged so you don t actually know if the remote application received your oh-so-important message to it. SNMPv2 PDUs fixed this by introducing the notion of an INFORM, which is nothing more than an acknowledged TRAP.",

        "explanation":  "SNMP is an application-layer protocol that provides a message format for communication between SNMP managers and agents. SNMP provides a standardized framework and a common language used for the monitoring and management of devices in a network.\nThe SNMP framework has three parts:\n+ An SNMP manager\n+ An SNMP agent\n+ A Management Information Base (MIB)\nThe SNMP manager is the system used to control and monitor the activities of network hosts using SNMP. The most common managing system is called a Network Management System (NMS). The term NMS can be applied to either a dedicated device used for network management, or the applications used on such a device. A variety of network management applications are available for use with SNMP. These features range from simple command-line applications to feature-rich graphical user interfaces (such as the CiscoWorks2000 line of products).\nThe SNMP agent is the software component within the managed device that maintains the data for the device and reports these data, as needed, to managing systems. The agent and MIB reside on the routing device (router, access server, or switch). To enable the SNMP agent on a Cisco routing device, you must define the relationship between the manager and the agent.\nThe Management Information Base (MIB) is a virtual information storage area for network management information, which consists of collections of managed objects.",

Without authentication, it is possible for nonauthorized users to exercise SNMP network management functions. It is also possible for nonauthorized users to eavesdrop on management information as it passes from managed systems to the management system. Because of these deficiencies, many SNMPv1/v2 implementations are limited to simply a read-only capability, reducing their utility to that of a network monitor; no network control applications can be supported.

        "explanation":  "The configuration shown here is an example of port security, specifically port security using sticky addresses. You can use port security with dynamically learned and static MAC addresses to restrict a port s ingress traffic by limiting the MAC addresses that are allowed to send traffic into the port. When you assign secure MAC addresses to a secure port, the port does not forward ingress traffic that has source addresses outside the group of defined addresses. If you limit the number of secure MAC addresses to one and assign a single secure MAC address, the device attached to that port has the full bandwidth of the port.\nPort security with sticky MAC addresses provides many of the same benefits as port security with static MAC addresses, but sticky MAC addresses can be learned dynamically.\nPort security with sticky MAC addresses retains dynamically learned MAC addresses during a link-down condition.",

SNMPv3 is the secure version.",

        "explanation":  "When an NMS (Network Management System) times out trying to poll SNMP data from a router, it means the NMS is not receiving a response. This often points to a connectivity or blocking issue.\n\n- **UDP port 161 is blocked on the network firewall.** (Most likely cause) SNMP uses UDP port 161 for polling. If this port is blocked (e.g., by a firewall or ACL between the NMS and the router), the NMS\u0027s requests will not reach the router or its responses will not reach the NMS, leading to a timeout.\n\n- Incorrect SNMP community string (Option A) is relevant for SNMPv1/v2c, but SNMPv3 uses user-based security (authentication/privacy) not community strings. \n- If the SNMP agent was disabled (Option B), the router wouldn\u0027t be listening on port 161, leading to a timeout, but blocking by a firewall is a more common issue in a configured scenario.\n- Missing \u0027authPriv\u0027 security level (Option C) would lead to authentication/privacy errors, not necessarily a timeout, if basic communication is established.",
