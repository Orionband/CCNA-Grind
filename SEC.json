The Wi-Fi Alliance defined WPA before the IEEE created their 802.11i security standard. After the IEEE ratified 802.11i, the Wi-Fi Alliance defined WPA2, to replace WPA, matching the details in the 802.11i standard. &nbsp;",

        "explanation": "WPA2-Personal mode uses a pre-shared key to authenticate wireless devices. Therefore, the pre-shared keys must be configured on every wireless device. If the key ever needs to be changed, network administrators must touch every device to enter a new key. As well, the 4-way handshake can be captured, allowing malicious users to launch an offline dictionary attack to recover the actual pre-shared key.

That said, to convert a wildcard mask back to a subnet mask, use the following technique: Take 255 and subtract the wildcard mask octet value. The first and second wildcard octets is 0, 255 &ndash; 0 = 255. The third wildcard octet is 31, 255 &ndash; 31 = 224. The fourth wildcard octet is 255, 255-255 = 0. This gives you a subnet mask of 255.255.224.0. The range of addresses can be found by taking the wildcard mask and adding it to the original network number configured. This will give you the highest range address; 192 + 0 = 192, 30 + 0 = 30, 32 + 31 = 63, 0 + 255 = 255. This makes the lowest number in the range 192.30.32.0 and the highest number 192.30.63.255.",

First, /24 converts to DDN mask 255.255.255.0. Subtract that value from 255.255.255.255 to find the wildcard mask:\n\n255.255.255.255 &ndash; 255.255.255.0 = 0.0.0.255\n\nAll the ACEs use the correct subnet ID and wildcard mask for this question. They also all use the any keyword as the destination address. Given the location as an outbound ACL on R1&#39;s G0/0/1 interface, the ACL attempts to match the correct packets: those sourced by the web servers in subnet 172.16.10.0/24&nbsp;and destined for any other address.\n\nAs for matching web traffic, you need to be aware of HTTP versions, the transport protocol used by each, and the default well-known ports. They include:\n\n\n\tHTTP 1.0, 1.1, and 2.0, which use TCP and default well-known server TCP port 80 when not using Secure HTTP\n\tHTTP 1.0, 1.1, and 2.0, which use TCP and default well-known server TCP port 443 when also using TLS and Secure HTTP\n\tHTTP 3.0, which uses UDP, TLS, and QUIC, and default well-known UDP port 443\n\n\nIn this case, the question asks about HTTP 1.1 with TLS. The ACE must match TCP (the correct transport protocol) and well-known TCP port 443 to match those packets. Note that all the ACEs place the well-known port in the source port location in the command because the ACL matches packets sent by the server. As a result:\n\n\n\tACE 10 does not match due to the udp keyword.\n\tACE 12 does match, due to: TCP, using the correct source and destination address values, with source port 443.\n\n\nThe router will not attempt to match later ACEs because IOS ACLs use first-match logic.",

Alternatively, using the same configuration process IOS supports for named ACLs to configure numbered ACLs. That process supports ACL configuration mode and line numbers, allowing you to remove one line in the ACL.

For instance, 10.22.33.0 + 0.0.0.63, added octet-by-octet, gives you 10.22.33.63.

For example, the ip access-group acl_01 out and ip access-group acl_02 in commands can coexist on an interface because they use opposite directions. However, if at that point you also configured another command to enable an IP ACL in the same direction on that interface &ndash; for instance, using the ip access-group acl_03 out command - it would replace the ip access-group 1 out command as the only outbound IP ACL on the interface.\n\n\nWith the IOS XE Common ACL feature, you can configure two IP ACLs per interface per direction. The command syntax changes to ip access-group common common-acl regular-acl in|out. IOS XE processes the ACLs as if it matches the common ACL first and then the regular ACL. As a result, the long-held rule of one IP ACL per interface per direction expands to two ACLs.",

So, the router accepts each command in succession, but it replaces the previous one.

The show ip interface command output lists those two ACLs on separate consecutive lines.

        "explanation": "Typical firewall zone configuration would serve to protect the inside of the network from potential attackers that exist on the open Internet. Because of this, it is common for firewall zones to be established; typically, these include an inside, outside, and DMZ zone. The inside zone is typically allowed to initiate traffic to both other zones; the outside zone is typically limited to only initiating connections to the DMZ; and the DMZ zone sits in an intermediate position and may be allowed to initiate some communications into the inside zone on a case-by-case basis to ensure security.",

        "explanation": "A stateful firewall has the capability to track historical information about traffic that has passed through it, to then make semi-intelligent decisions based on that historical information. With these capabilities, a stateful firewall is properly enabled to mitigate a DoS attack. For instance, if can monitor the number of TCP connections to each IP address over time, watching for volumes that seem out-of-range versus normal operation.\n\n\tA stateless firewall and router ACL do not have the mechanisms or capabilities to provide any sort of historical information about the traffic that has passed through the security function. While they can match individual packets, they cannot consider past packets and trends that can identify a DoS attack.\n\n\tA security zone is a security component of a firewall where a designation is determined. Normally there is an inside and outside security zone, and traffic can be segmented between these zones one way or another. For example, traffic initiated from the inside security zone can traverse through the outside security zone, but traffic initiated from the outside security zone cannot traverse the inside security zone without proper approval. A security zone does not mitigate a DoS attack.",

The ports all use a default setting of untrusted for DHCP Snooping, meaning that DHCP Snooping will prevent PC4 from becoming a DHCP server.\n\n\tAdditionally, to support normal DHCP operations, you need to change some ports to be trusted so that SW2 will not filter DHCP messages originally sent by the legitimate DHCP server. The server connectes to SW2&#39;s Gi0/12 port, also in VLAN 20. To allow those server messages, SW2 also needs an&nbsp;ip dhcp snooping trust&nbsp;command on SW2&#39;s port Gi0/12, which connects to the DHCP server.&nbsp;",

I&rsquo;m talking about beyond the depth of CCNA. Those two features can be tricky and subtle.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat said, in this question, keep this concept in mind: Which switch ports might receive messages sent by a legitimate DHCP server? In the topology shown, on SW2, the only legitimate DHCP server is on SW2&rsquo;s G0/24, so that&rsquo;s the only port that needs to be trusted. That other port you believe should be trusted, SW2&rsquo;s G0/12, would not receive messages from a legit DHCP in the network shown.<br />\n\tNow, if other legit DHCP servers existed on the other side of that router, and just were not shown in the figure, then yes, you&rsquo;d have a reason to trust that port.&quot;<br />\n\t6/8 - query to Au</p>\n<p>\n\t3/1 - ok as-is, &quot; A &ldquo;rogue&rdquo; DHCP server is not the normal intended DHCP server, but with the attacker running a DHCP server on some other device.

        "explanation": "To properly enable DAI on switch 2 for VLAN 20, the following commands would need to be issued: The command ip arp inspection vlan 20 would be issued globally, which would also enable DAI on all ports assigned to VLAN 20, including trunk ports.\n\n\tThen, for ports connected to devices which do not lease an address with DHCP (servers, routers, switches, and so on), the configurartion should then trust the port so that DAI does not filter ARPs. To do so, the configuration adds the ip arp inspection trust command on switch SW2&#39;s Gi0/12 port, which connects to the DHCP server, as well as Gi0/24, which connects to switch SW1. The correct answer does so by first using the interface range gi0/12,gi0/24 command to select both Gi0/12 and Gi0/24.",

        "explanation": "Unless the configuration is saved to NVRAM, the switch will not use the updated configuration information, including the hostname, the next time it reboots. The show version shows a reboot, which could be due to loss of power and restoration of power, that occurred 1 day, 3 hours, and 24 minutes previous to when the user issued the show command, and that is when it reverted back to its original hostname.\n\nConfigurations may be saved to NVRAM, TFTP servers, and other destinations, but not to a configuration register.

        "questionText": "The text below reveals the first lines of an ACL enabled for outbound packets on router R1&#39;s G0/0/1 interface. Clients on the right side of the figure connect to the web servers on the left. All web servers use default well-known ports. When a client connects using HTTP/3, which ACE matches the packets?\n\n\nR1# show access-list Hannah\n\n  10 permit udp 172.16.10.0 0.0.0.255 eq 443 any\n  12 permit tcp 172.16.10.0 0.0.0.255 eq 443 any\n  20 permit tcp 172.16.10.0 0.0.0.255 eq 80 any\n  22 permit udp 172.16.10.0 0.0.0.255 eq 80 any\n&hellip;",
        "explanation": "First, note that all the ACEs match the correct source address range per the 172.16.10.0 0.0.0.255 parameters. Those parameters match the addresses in the server subnet. The ACEs all match any destination address using the any keyword. As a result, the question drills down on the other matching parameters.\n\nAs for matching web traffic, you need to be aware of HTTP versions, the transport protocol used by each, and the default well-known ports. They include:\n\n\n\tHTTP 1.0, 1.1, and 2.0, which use TCP and default well-known server TCP port 80 when not using Secure HTTP\n\tHTTP 1.0, 1.1, and 2.0, which use TCP and default well-known server TCP port 443 when also using TLS and Secure HTTP\n\tHTTP 3.0, which uses UDP, TLS, and QUIC, and default well-known UDP port 443\n\n\nIn this case, the question asks about HTTP/3. HTTP/3 uses only UDP (and not TCP) and uses&nbsp;well-known UDP port 443 defined for QUIK to match those packets. HTTP/3 requires encryption, so HTTP/3 does not use well-known port 80. As for the ACEs, the correct ACE should match port 443 as the source port because the ACL&#39;s location matches packets&nbsp;sent by the server. As a result:\n\n\n\tACE 10 matches, due to: UDP, using the correct source and destination address values, with source port 443.\n\n\nThe router will not consider later ACEs because IOS ACLs use first-match logic, but none of the ACEs would match the packets anyway.",

        "explanation": "By default, Cisco devices do not participate in Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP). The first command that needs to be configured is lldp run, which starts the switch participating in LLDP.

        "explanation": "A VLAN hopping attack exploits a misconfigured trunk port, often by tricking a switch into thinking the attacker's host is another switch and forming a trunk. The best defense is to disable Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP) negotiation on trunk ports ('switchport nonegotiate') and to explicitly configure all user-facing ports as static access ports ('switchport mode access').",

You can use port security with dynamically learned and static MAC addresses to restrict a port\u2019s ingress traffic by limiting the MAC addresses that are allowed to send traffic into the port. When you assign secure MAC addresses to a secure port, the port does not forward ingress traffic that has source addresses outside the group of defined addresses. If you limit the number of secure MAC addresses to one and assign a single secure MAC address, the device attached to that port has the full bandwidth of the port.\nPort security with sticky MAC addresses provides many of the same benefits as port security with static MAC addresses, but sticky MAC addresses can be learned dynamically.\nPort security with sticky MAC addresses retains dynamically learned MAC addresses during a link-down condition.",

        "explanation": "SNMP is an application-layer protocol that provides a message format for communication between SNMP managers and agents. SNMP provides a standardized framework and a common language used for the monitoring and management of devices in a network.\nThe SNMP framework has three parts:\n+ An SNMP manager\n+ An SNMP agent\n+ A Management Information Base (MIB)\nThe SNMP manager is the system used to control and monitor the activities of network hosts using SNMP. The most common managing system is called a Network Management System (NMS). The term NMS can be applied to either a dedicated device used for network management, or the applications used on such a device. A variety of network management applications are available for use with SNMP. These features range from simple command-line applications to feature-rich graphical user interfaces (such as the CiscoWorks2000 line of products).\nThe SNMP agent is the software component within the managed device that maintains the data for the device and reports these data, as needed, to managing systems. The agent and MIB reside on the routing device (router, access server, or switch). To enable the SNMP agent on a Cisco routing device, you must define the relationship between the manager and the agent.\nThe Management Information Base (MIB) is a virtual information storage area for network management information, which consists of collections of managed objects.",

Without authentication, it is possible for nonauthorized users to exercise SNMP network management functions. It is also possible for nonauthorized users to eavesdrop on management information as it passes from managed systems to the management system. Because of these deficiencies, many SNMPv1/v2 implementations are limited to simply a read-only capability, reducing their utility to that of a network monitor; no network control applications can be supported. To correct the security deficiencies of SNMPv1/v2, SNMPv3 was issued as a set of Proposed Standards in January 1998. -> A is correct.",

You can use port security with dynamically learned and static MAC addresses to restrict a port\u2019s ingress traffic by limiting the MAC addresses that are allowed to send traffic into the port. When you assign secure MAC addresses to a secure port, the port does not forward ingress traffic that has source addresses outside the group of defined addresses. If you limit the number of secure MAC addresses to one and assign a single secure MAC address, the device attached to that port has the full bandwidth of the port.\nPort security with sticky MAC addresses provides many of the same benefits as port security with static MAC addresses, but sticky MAC addresses can be learned dynamically.\nPort security with sticky MAC addresses retains dynamically learned MAC addresses during a link-down condition.",

        "explanation": "Cisco devices offer various security features:\n\n- **SSH for secure remote access:** Encrypts remote management sessions, protecting credentials and data (preferred over Telnet).\n- **AAA for authentication, authorization, and accounting:** Centralizes user access control, determining who can access resources and what they can do.\n- **Port security to restrict access on switch ports:** Limits the number and identity of MAC addresses allowed on a port, preventing unauthorized device access.\n- **NAT for IP address translation:** While its primary role is address conservation, it adds a layer of security by hiding internal IP addresses from external networks.\n\n- **SNMPv1 for secure network monitoring** is false; SNMPv1 transmits data in plaintext and lacks robust authentication, making it insecure. SNMPv3 is the secure version.",

        "explanation": "When an NMS (Network Management System) times out trying to poll SNMP data from a router, it means the NMS is not receiving a response. This often points to a connectivity or blocking issue.\n\n- **UDP port 161 is blocked on the network firewall.** (Most likely cause) SNMP uses UDP port 161 for polling. If this port is blocked (e.g., by a firewall or ACL between the NMS and the router), the NMS's requests will not reach the router or its responses will not reach the NMS, leading to a timeout.\n\n- Incorrect SNMP community string (Option A) is relevant for SNMPv1/v2c, but SNMPv3 uses user-based security (authentication/privacy) not community strings. \n- If the SNMP agent was disabled (Option B), the router wouldn't be listening on port 161, leading to a timeout, but blocking by a firewall is a more common issue in a configured scenario.\n- Missing 'authPriv' security level (Option C) would lead to authentication/privacy errors, not necessarily a timeout, if basic communication is established.",

They need to configure a WLAN (Wireless LAN) for employees that requires user authentication using 802.1X with RADIUS server integration, and also needs to encrypt wireless traffic using strong encryption. Which of the following WLAN security configurations on the WLC would best meet these requirements?",
        "explanation": "To meet the requirements of **user authentication using 802.1X with RADIUS integration** and **strong encryption** for an enterprise WLAN, the best security configuration is:\n\n- **WPA2 Enterprise (802.1X) with AES encryption.**\n\nLet's break it down:\n- **WPA2 Enterprise (802.1X):** This provides strong, centralized, and individual user authentication by integrating with an external RADIUS server (like Cisco ISE). It's scalable and auditable for enterprise environments.\n- **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard):** This is a robust and modern encryption algorithm that provides strong data confidentiality for wireless traffic.\n\n- Other options are weaker:\n    - **Open System Authentication with WEP:** Highly insecure, easily cracked.\n    - **WPA2 Personal (PSK):** Uses a pre-shared key, not individual 802.1X authentication, and is less manageable for enterprises.\n    - **WPA2 Enterprise (802.1X) with TKIP:** While 802.1X authentication is good, TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol) is an older, weaker encryption algorithm compared to AES and has known vulnerabilities. AES is preferred for strong encryption with WPA2 Enterprise.",

Choosing a strong encryption algorithm is crucial for this phase.\n\n- **DES (Data Encryption Standard):** Weak, 56-bit key, easily broken. Not recommended.\n- **3DES (Triple DES):** Applies DES three times, stronger than DES but still considered less secure and slower than AES. Less commonly used now.\n- **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard):** The current industry standard and strongest symmetric-key encryption algorithm among the options. Available in 128-bit, 192-bit, and 256-bit key sizes. Recommended for high-security applications in IPsec.\n- **MD5 (Message Digest 5):** A hash function, not an encryption algorithm.
