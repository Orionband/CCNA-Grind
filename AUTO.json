        "questionText": "What option(s) are required criteria for a service to be a cloud service?",
        "explanation": "Five specific criteria are required for a service to be a cloud service:\n\n\t\n\t\tOn-demand self-service: You determine when you want and do not want a service.\n\t\n\t\tBroad network access: The cloud service must be accessible by numerous connectivity options and a fast number of devices should be able to leverage it.\n\t\n\t\tResource pooling: Instead of assigning dedicated resources, such as memory and CPU, to each system, resources can be shared across a set of services, servers, and systems. These shared resources are then dynamically allocated on-demand as a system needs it.\n\t\n\t\tRapid elasticity: A cloud service is very different from an on-premise virtual environment. There are still capabilities like resource pooling on-premise, but with rapid elasticity it&rsquo;s hard to come by. Rapid elasticity makes the pools of resources seem unlimited. New resource requests are completed rapidly.\n\t\n\t\tMeasured service: In a cloud service, utilization is tracked and monitored, which can then be reported on by the operator. This is used for billing but also can be used for other capabilities if needed by an organization.\n\n\n\tBoth agile network access and proactive service are unrelated to a cloud service offering and refer to business architecture principals.",

Which answers accurately compare and contrast VMs and containers? (Choose two answers.)",
        "explanation": "Virtual Machines (VMs) rely on a virtualization system with a hypervisor. The VM includes an installed OS, so starting a VLM includes initializing (booting) the OS. That process relies on the usual computer components: CPU, RAM, disk, and network. The hypervisor virtualizes those computer resources so the VM can be initialized and run.\n\nA container image does not include an OS and does not rely on a virtualization system or hypervisor. Instead, it depends on an OS with container support and a container engine. The container image includes all software components needed to run an application besides the OS. The container engine enables the management of starting and stopping containers.\n\nAs for the answers, VMs use a hypervisor, while containers do not, instead using a container engine. Also, initializing a VM includes booting an OS, so starting a VM may take several minutes. Starting a container takes seconds, more like the time taken to start an application.",

For example, ACEs could not be removed because of the potential risk of failure to the entire ACL. New changes add to the current ACL, which ends up being more complicated the longer it gets.\n\nCisco SD-Access instead uses group-based security with SGTs. Instead of hard coding a security rule in a list like an ACL, you can identify who and what something is, assign a value to it, and then look up that value in a grid or matrix to validate what the user should and shouldn&rsquo;t be doing. With this new model, there are some huge benefits:\n\n\n\tEach new security requirement can be considered separately from the existing policies.\n\tCisco SD-Access (through Cisco Catalyst Center) keeps the security policies clear as a grid of security groups and their allowed access\n\tAs a result, each policy can be removed without affecting another policy.\n\tThe user interface includes note-taking space to&nbsp;track why a policy was created.\n\tThere is proper logging of when the policy is being used and by whom, and when the policy was last used.\n\n\nFor the incorrect answers, first, note that the user interface in Cisco Catalyst Center shows the SGT access policies as a grid, rather than showing the matching logic as compiled into an integrated whole, making it much easier to work with the policies. You can add new SGTs, and set their access rights (permit, deny), without considering any changes to the existing parts of the table.",

In that case, DNA-C can choose its preferred features and configuration to create the underlay, which uses IS-IS as the IGP. A brownfield deployment, which means that you begin with a working campus LAN and improve it to support SDA, can use any IGP. So, the more general requirement is IP connectivity, with a preference for using IS-IS if starting from scratch (aka Greenfield.) &quot;</p>\n\n<p>12/1 - query to Au</p>\n\n<p>12/13 - ok as-is, 11/27 - query to Au</p>\n\n<p>4/3/24 Updated SDA to Cisco SD-Access -JG</p>\n",

        "explanation": "In a Cisco SD-Access fabric, the underlay IP addressing scheme uses a separate IP address space as compared to endpoint devices and the overlay network. The endpoint addresses (like PC1 and PC2 in this question) use addresses from the same address space as the overlay tunnels (address range 192.168.0.0/16 in this question.) The underlay uses addresses from the range 172.16.0.0/12. Also, switches SW2 and SW3, which do not sit at the edge of the network (and are therefore not Fabric Edge or Fabric Border nodes), do not participate in the overlay at all. So, of the four answers, only the correct answer shows all four addresses from the underlay range 172.16.0.0/12. Of the incorrect answers, some list addresses from the overlay address space that would be useful on edge/border nodes SW1 and SW4, but those answers also overlay addresses for switches SW2 and SW3, which do not need addresses in the overlay address space at all.",

Caching can speed up the operations and the responses to the users.\n\t\n\t\tUniform interface: In the RESTful world, everything is perceived to be a resource, no matter whether it&rsquo;s a document, function, method, class, or module.

Configuration drift is when changes are made to a device or multiple devices that are not the intended configurations.\n\n\tThis is not version control. Version control is tracking the different changes that have occurred in a repository or system and creating version numbers for each change. This enables you as an operator to restore a past configuration version if the need arises.\n\n\tCentralized configuration is a process of moving the configurations to a central server or service. The key with this process is to make sure future changes to configurations are actually completed on the central server and not on the individual devices themselves.\n\n\tConfiguration monitoring is an alert that the configuration of a device is different than the intended configuration.

An API can be considered \u201cRESTful\u201d if it has the following features:\n* Client/server \u2013 The client handles the front end and the server handles the back end.\n* Stateless \u2013 No client data is stored on the server between requests. The session state is stored on the client.\n* Cacheable \u2013 Clients can cache responses locally to improve performance.",

        "explanation": "Spine-leaf architecture is typically deployed as two layers: spines (such as an aggregation layer), and leaves (such as an access layer). Spine-leaf topologies provide high-bandwidth, low-latency, non-blocking server-to-server connectivity. Leaf (aggregation) switches are what provide devices access to the fabric (the network of spine and leaf switches) and are typically deployed at the top of the rack. Generally, devices connect to the leaf switches. Devices can include servers, Layer 4-7 services (firewalls and load balancers), and WAN or Internet routers. Leaf switches do not connect to other leaf switches. In spine-and-leaf architecture, every leaf should connect to every spine in a full mesh. Spine (aggregation) switches are used to connect to all leaf switches and are typically deployed at the end or middle of the row. Spine switches do not connect to other spine switches.",
