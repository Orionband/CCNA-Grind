Also, using 5-GHz channels 36 and 40 would also result in nonoverlap because the usable 5-GHz channel numbers are spaced appropriately so that they do not overlap.\n\nFor the incorrect answers, in the 2.4-GHz band, channels 1 and 2 are spaced much too closely, causing extensive overlap. In the 5-GHz band, the available non-overlapping channel numbers increment by 4: channels 36, 40, 44, 48, and so on. So, the answer that suggests using 5 GHz channels 36 and 37 is invalid.",

For example, you should use only channels that are at least five channel numbers apart, as in channels 1, 6, and 11. You could also use channels 4 and 9, but that would limit the number of possible channels that could be used. You should not use just any channel, as the APs could overlap with each other quite easily. You should not use the same channel on each Cisco AP because each AP will overlap and interfere with all others within range.",

You have carefully configured the WLAN and policy profiles with the new WLAN&rsquo;s SSID, security, and the correct VLAN number. Then you mapped those profiles to a policy tag called Main_policy_tag. You made sure the new WLAN was enabled and that it would be broadcast. You also enabled the 2.4 and 5 GHz bands for the WLAN. You feel comfortable that any other parameters related to AP operation and RF settings will be inherited from the default profiles that come preconfigured on the controller. \n\nFor some reason, the new WLAN does not seem to be working&mdash;no users can pick up the new SSID from it. Which one of the following is most likely the step you have forgotten to perform?",
        "explanation": "From the problem description, it sounds like you did everything correctly. You built the WLAN and policy profiles for the new WLAN, made sure the WLAN was enabled and used on the correct frequency bands, and made sure the SSID would be broadcast so clients could discover it. However, all the work you put into configuring the profiles were never actually used by the APs.

        "explanation": "Because the AP is part of a split-MAC architecture, so it must join with a WLC. Regardless of the number of VLANs to support on the wireless side, the AP requires only an access mode switch port. The multiple VLANs are carried over a CAPWAP tunnel between the AP and WLC, so no trunk port is needed.&nbsp;\n\nThe switch would not use a routed port because the AP does not act as a layer 3 device. A WLC port is not a type of switch port at all, so it is incorrect too.",

In fact, after configuring the profile name, WLC defaults to set the SSID to the same value. They are both text values with a max length of 32 characters.\n\nOf the other fields in the answers, the VLAN ID and WLAN ID use numeric values but represent different concepts with different value ranges. The WLC uses the WLAN ID as an internal number for wireless LANs, supporting values from 1-512. The VLAN ID must match the VLAN ID used in the distribution system (the wired network), with WLC supporting values 1-1001 and 1007-4094.\n\nFinally, the dynamic interface name is a text name that does not match any other listed fields.",

        "explanation": "LAN switches dynamically inform attached IP phones what VLAN ID to use for the phone&rsquo;s traffic on the pseudo-trunk between the switch and the phone. The original Cisco IP phones supported only Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) to declare the VLAN ID to the phone. Newer Cisco phones now support the standards-based LLDP-MED protocol for the same purpose &ndash; although they also support CDP. Non-Cisco phones never used the Cisco-proprietary CDP for learning phone settings, preferring LLDP from their earliest days.\n\nAs for the answers that mention static settings, the phones do not use a static setting for the voice VLAN on the link. Instead, they use CDP or LLDP-MED to learn the VLAN ID dynamically.",

LLDP Media Endpoint Discovery (LLDP-MED) refers to a set of endpoint-focused TLVs. LLDP-MED includes the TLVs that enable switches to inform an attached IP phone what voice VLAN ID to use on the link.

The timer value is set to 180 and the holdtime timer is set to 60.

        "comments": "<p>10/13 - ok as-is &quot;On this one, you paraphrased what you believe the book to claim, and I think that&rsquo;s the problem. You paraphrased some rules from the book but omitted the context. That text in the book describes what happens when one device disables auto negotiation. It goes on to say how Cisco switches work in that case. However, this question clearly states that the PCs and switch port use auto negotiation, so the rules you quoted do not apply here. Instead, the endpoints on each link choose the fastest speed that both support and the best duplex that both support, full being better than half.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>10/4 - query to Au</p>\n\n<p>8/8 - ok as-is &quot;Interesting, it looks like you are referring to the logic used when IEEE auto-negotiation does not work. In this question, it is working, as detailed in the explanation to the question. In short, both ends state their best speed and best duplex, and they agree to use the fastest speed that both support at use the better duplex (full) if both support it. In this case, one supports 1 Gbps, the other support 100 Mbps, and both support full duplex. So, they agree to the fastest speed that they both support (100 Mbps), and to use the best duplex they both support (full). There&rsquo;s no need to use auto-negotiation defaults for duplex because the auto-negotiation process is working, with both devices stating their abilities.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>8/4, 7/26 - query to Au</p>\n\n<p>6/28 - ok as-is, &quot; With both the switch and PC using auto negotiation, they communicate the idea that they each can support both half and full duplex, and then they both choose the better option: full duplex. I wonder if you&rsquo;re thinking of the default choice of auto negotiation that would happen if one device did not use auto negotiation. For example, if PC B disabled auto negotiation, SW1 could sense that PC B was using 100 Mbps - without using autonegotation but by sensing the electrical signal - and choose the correct 100 Mbps speed. But without those auto negotiation messages, that&rsquo;s the case in which SW1 would have to use the default duplex, which as you noted would be half duplex if the speed is 10 or 100 Mbps. Different case in this question - both ends use autonegotiation, so they both choose the better duplex setting.</p>\n\n<p>6/23 - query to Au</p>\n\n<p>6/17 - sent reader suggestion to au,</p>\n\n<p>8/18 - ok as-is, Cisco does not use a separate auto negotiation standard. I wonder if you might have misread the question. The question stem states that auto negotiation is enabled. IEEE auto negotiation chooses the best (that is, full) duplex supported by both endpoints when auto negotiation is enabled and working. I wonder if you are thinking of the IEEE auto negotiation choice when the device on the other end of the link does not use auto negotiation, in which case at 10 and 100 MBps, the duplex would default to half. The book gets into comparing both sets of conditions (Vol 1 Chapter 7.)</p>\n\n<p>7/28 - query to Au, 11/18 - ok as-is, 10/29 - query to Au</p>\n",

Some PCs have power, and some have cables connecting them to the switch, but some have no power or no cable. The show interfaces status command lists both a speed and duplex column. Which answers accurately describe the output in those columns for the combined three interfaces? (Choose two answers.)",
        "explanation": "First, consider the three cases. On port G1/0/1, the PC has power, and a cable exists. As a result, the link works, and then autonegotiation works. However, on the other two links, a problem exists, so the link does not work. On G1/0/2, no cable exists, and on G1/0/3, the PC has no power. So, those links do not work, so no autonegotiation occurs.\n\nSecond, you must recall that the default settings for speed and duplex on switch interfaces cause them to use autonegotiation. As a result, the show interfaces status command, for interfaces in a down/down (notconnect) state, lists a status as if autonegotiation is yet to be done, using the word &quot;auto&quot; in each case. So, the output for G1/0/2 and G1/0/3 lists the speed and duplex as &quot;auto.&quot; \n\nFor the working interface, G1/0/1, the output lists &quot;a-1000&quot; for the speed, meaning it autonegotiated to use 1000 Mbps. Similarly, the output shows &quot;a-full&quot; in the duplex heading, meaning it autonegotiated to use full duplex.\n\nThree answers suggest values under the speed column for two interfaces. Two interfaces will list a speed value of &quot;auto&quot; (interfaces G1/0/2 and G1/0/3), making that answer correct. Three answers suggest values under the duplex column for exactly one interface. The answer listing &quot;a-full&quot; is correct, as interface G1/0/1 completes autonegotiation and chooses full duplex.\n&nbsp;",

        "explanation": "As configured, SW2 will use a speed of 1000 and full duplex and will not send auto-negotiation messages. As a result, you need to think about how SW1 will behave, which is the essence of the question.\n\nSwitch SW1 uses IEEE parallel detection rules to detect the speed to use on the link, even with autonegotiation disabled on the SW2 end&nbsp;of the link. As a result, SW1 also uses 1000 Mbps (that is, 1 Gigabit/second). The IEEE parallel detection rules then state that to choose the duplex setting, use a default value based on the speed used. Those rules state that when running at 1 Gbps, to use full duplex. As a result, the link will come up because both switches use the same speed, and they will both use full duplex.&nbsp;\n\nThe three incorrect answers show a variety of incorrect combinations versus what actually happens.\n\n&nbsp;",

They are both automatic.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs to the subtleties, &ldquo;auto-negotiation&rdquo; is the term that specifically refers to an IEEE defined protocol. However, that protocol relies on both endpoints to participate in a message exchange. In this question, SW2 does not participate, so the question is asking about what else switch SW1 does to determine the speed. That logic includes other automatic processes that do not require messages to be exchanged w/ SW2 by which SW1 senses the speed by examining the incoming signal on the line.<br />\n\tWhile the question&rsquo;s explanation doesn&rsquo;t provide the same level of detail, the book gets into detail about these differences, hence the question to review those concepts. If you refer to print page 160 of the Volume 1 book (Chapter 7 heading Autonegotiation results when only one node&hellip;&rdquo; in case you have an e-book), you&rsquo;ll see this specific case about IEEE auto-negotiation logic vs the additional feature to sense the speed without using IEEE auto-negotiation.&quot;&nbsp; 3/8, 7/20 - query to Au</p>\n",

        "questionText": "The figure displays three PCs connected to a switch. All PC NICs support the highest speeds. Some PCs have power, and some have cables connecting them to the switch, but some have no power or no cable. The show interfaces status command lists both a speed and duplex column. Which answers accurately describe the output in those columns for the combined three interfaces? (Choose two answers.)",
        "explanation": "First, consider the three cases. On port G1/0/1, the PC has power, and a cable exists. As a result, the link works, and then autonegotiation works. However, on the other two links, a problem exists, so the link does not work. On G1/0/2, no cable exists, and on G1/0/3, the PC has no power. So, those links do not work, so no autonegotiation occurs.\n\nSecond, you must recall that the default settings for speed and duplex on switch interfaces cause them to use autonegotiation. As a result, the show interfaces status command, for interfaces in a down/down (notconnect) state, lists a status as if autonegotiation is yet to be done, using the word &quot;auto&quot; in each case. So, the output for G1/0/2 and G1/0/3 lists the speed and duplex as &quot;auto.&quot;\n\nFor the working interface, G1/0/1, the output lists &quot;a-1000&quot; for the speed, meaning it autonegotiated to use 1000 Mbps. Similarly, the output shows &quot;a-full&quot; in the duplex heading, meaning it autonegotiated to use full duplex.\n\nThree answers suggest values under the speed column for one interface only. The answer that includes &quot;a-1000&quot; is correct, as only interface G1/0/1 has that speed status value. Three answers suggest values under the duplex column for two interfaces. The answer listing &quot;auto&quot; is correct, as interfaces G1/0/2 and G1/0/3 would both list that value.",

The no switchport mode trunk command tells the switch to revert to the default setting for trunk negotiation. The default on most Cisco Catalyst switches&nbsp;is dynamic auto, which tells the switch to react to any received negotiation messages.\n\nOne incorrect answer mentions the no switchport mode trunk command, which tells the switch to revert to the default setting for trunk negotiation. The default on most Cisco access switches is switchport mode dynamic auto, which tells the switch to react to any received negotiation messages. So the switch port would negotiate trunking if the neighboring switch requested it.\n\nAnother incorrect answer lists the switchport access vlan x command. This command defines the VLAN to statically assign to the port if it acts as an access port, but the command does not prevent the switch from attempting to negotiate trunking on the port.\n\nThe remaining incorrect answers show commands that do not exist in Cisco switches.\n\n&nbsp;",

Which answers list facts that the output in the exhibit confirms? (Choose two answers.)",
        "explanation": "The answers come in pairs. Both pairs require you to know the logic IOS uses to decide which interfaces to list in the output from the command. In particular:\n\nThe command lists all interfaces with the interface&#39;s configured access VLAN, whether up or down, except for interfaces in an up/up (connect) state and operating as a VLAN trunk.\n\nExamining the two answers about interface G1/0/8, the output lists that interface in the interface group for VLAN 3. That tells us the access VLAN configured for that interface (which confirms one correct answer.) However, G1/0/8 will appear in the output whether in a connected (up/up) or notconnect (down/down) state. So you cannot know the interface&#39;s state by seeing the interface in this command&#39;s output.\n\nFor the two answers that mention interface G1/0/17, note that the output does not list the interface. That means the interface currently operates as a trunk. That is, it has an operational state of trunking. The interface must therefore be working, making the one answer that mentions G1/0/17 correct and one incorrect.",

That creates an issue on the trunk. Switch SW1 uses the default native VLAN 1, while switch SW2 now uses native VLAN 11 per the new configuration. Mismatched native VLANs cause frames in the two VLANs on either side of the link to either (a) not flow across the trunk or (b) flow but hop (change) VLANs. Both are problems; the configuration should instead set the same native VLAN number on both ends of the trunk. So, the new configuration breaks the trunk.\n\nThe configuration also changes the native VLAN setting on switch SW2&#39;s ports connected to the PCs, specifically G1/0/4 through G1/0/6. Those ports, as stated in the question stem, are access ports. Therefore, the native VLAN setting does not impact those ports&#39; operation, making one answer correct.

Because of this, SW3 will choose its Gi0/1 link as its root port.\n\n\tRegarding G0/1 becoming the designated port, it will not, because G0/1 is the root port.\n\n\tRegarding whether SW3&rsquo;s Fa0/13 will become a designated port, we know that SW3 is receiving a Hello on F0/13 with root cost 10. SW3 would advertise it&#39;s root cost as 24. The designated port is the port out which the least-cost Hello is advertised, so the other switch off SW3&#39;s F0/13 port would win the election, and SW3&#39;s F0/13 would not be the designated port.",

        "explanation": "Using the default port costs, a Gigabit Ethernet port will have a cost of 4 and a Fast Ethernet port will have a cost of 19. SW3 will have two interfaces that can be used to forward traffic to the root switch (SW4): through its Gi0/1 interface via SW1, which results in a total cost of 8, or via its Fa0/2 interface, which results in a total cost of 19. It will select the option with the lowest cost, so it will select its Gi0/1 interface as its root port with a cost of 8.\n\nSummarizing the competing potential root paths and their costs:\n\n\n\tSW3 G0/1 - SW1 G0/3&nbsp; - 4 + 4 = 8\n\tSW3 G0/1 - SW1 G0/1&nbsp;- SW2 G0/2&nbsp; - 4 + 4 + 4 = 12\n\tSW3 F0/2&nbsp; - 19",

It&rsquo;s cost (default) is 4. Then, looking at SW1, also a non-root, it&rsquo;s root port is SW1&rsquo;s G0/3 port, which connects to the root switch, SW4. That adds 4 more. That gives the correct root cost of 8. I&rsquo;m wondering if for some reason you believe SW1&rsquo;s root port would be its G0/1 port? Or that SW2 would be root?

The links from SW3 up to SW1 and then down to SW4 are both GigabitEthernet which have a cost of 4 giving the total cost 8 for that path which is lower than 19 across the FastEthernet Link. SW3 will choose Gi0/1 as Root Port with a cost of 8.

Which of the following statements about RSTP states and roles in this network are true?",
        "explanation": "The alternate port role in RSTP serves as an alternate root port. The only requirement for a non-root port to be an alternate root port is to receive Hellos that identify the same root switch as the Hello received on the root port. In this RSTP topology, SW2&rsquo;s Gi0/1 port will receive Hellos directly from SW3 (the root). SW2&rsquo;s Gi0/2 must also receive Hellos identifying SW3 as root, based on the facts stated in the question and the diagram. As a result, SW2&rsquo;s Gi0/1 port must be an RSTP alternate port.\n\nHowever, SW1 will not receive Hellos from SW2&#39;s G0/2&nbsp;port, as SW2&#39;s G0/2&nbsp;port is a root port. (Root ports expect to receive Hellos from the neighboring switch, but the switch does not forward Hellos out the root port.)\n\nAs for the two answers that mention a backup port,&nbsp;none of the ports can&nbsp;have a backup port role due to the current physical topology. To have a backup port with today&#39;s Ethernet devices, one switch must connect more than one port to the same Ethernet segment, typically by connecting two ports to the same LAN hub. The figure shows no LAN hubs, so no ports can become backup ports.",

        "explanation": "PortFast and BPDU Guard can be run independently. PortFast-enabled ports bypass the listening and learning states of STP and move into the forwarding state. If another switch is plugged into a PortFast protected port or any other port, BPDUs will be sent over that port. If BPDU Guard is enabled and a BPDU is detected, the port will be put into an err-disabled state. Trunk links are typically between more than one switch and would require the passing of BPDUs between the switches.

        "explanation": "Root Guard is used to prevent unplanned switches from becoming the Root Bridge. Root Guard is configured on a port-by-port basis and listens to the BPDUs and determines whether the port receives a superior BPDU. If a superior BPDU is received, Root Guard prevents the election of a different root switch that is reachable through that port. Root Guard doesn&rsquo;t forward superior BPDUs to another switch; it instead puts the port into what&rsquo;s called &ldquo;root-inconsistent&rdquo; or &ldquo;broken&rdquo; state until no superior BPDUs are being received in the hellos. Then the port automatically recovers back to a functioning state. Inferior BPDUs have no impact on Root Guard or the operational state of the port.",

The answers list ports that are neither root port nor designated port. Choose the answer that lists an RSTP port role that is meaningful for that port in this topology.",
        "explanation": "The alternate port role acts as an alternate root port, while the backup port role serves as a backup designated port for a designated port on the same switch.\n\n\tFirst, for the answers that mention &ldquo;backup port,&rdquo; note that for a port to act as backup port, it must back up a designated port on that same switch. Also, that backup port must connect to the same collision domain. The collision domains include all the point-to-point links between switches and the links connected to the one LAN hub. Based on these facts, neither SW3 nor SW2 can have a backup port, because each does not connect with two ports to the same collision domain. However, switch SW4 does connect with two ports to the same collision domain (as created by the hub), so SW4 could use port F0/2 as an RSTP backup port.\n\n\tFor the alternate port concept, each nonroot switch can have an alternate (root) port. The alternate cannot also be serving in the designated port role or already be serving in the root port role. Based on those rules, SW3&#39;s F0/4 and SW4&#39;s G0/1 could both be the alternate port.

The endpoint on an access switch port will never see any of the VLAN information that was associated with the frame. A trunk port will carry the frame along with the VLAN information until it gets to the other side of the trunk link. Voice ports also carry the frame along with VLAN tagging information.

        "explanation": "STP is used to prevent loops within the Layer 2 network and is independent of EtherChannel. In STP an EtherChannel bundle shows up as a single interface. In addition, if there is a link failure on one of the member links within an EtherChannel, STP Convergence will not need to happen because the EtherChannel interface itself never goes down because member links continue to operate during the individual link failure.

        "explanation": "Loop Guard is used to prevent higher (poor) priority switches from moving their alternate or blocking ports to a forwarding state in the event of a unidirectional link failure. This typically occurs with fiber optic cable failures. This is when the device can&rsquo;t detect the fiber failure and attempts to forward traffic down a link that can only send or receive traffic due to the broken fiber cable. When a Loop Guard&ndash;enabled port stops receiving BPDUs from its upstream neighbor for a certain period, it places the port into a &ldquo;loop-inconsistent&rdquo; or &ldquo;broken&rdquo; state. The port stops forwarding traffic until it begins receiving BPDUs again from its upstream neighbor. This prevents the port from transitioning to the forwarding state due to a lack of BPDUs, which could lead to a forwarding loop if the network topology has changed. Designated and alternate ports cannot by definition become a root port.",

        "explanation": "In RSTP, if a switch stops receiving BPDUs on a port, it waits for three times the Hello time before initiating a topology change. The default Hello time is 2 seconds, so the switch will wait 6 seconds (3*2 seconds) before reacting and initiating a topology change. Note that the switch will only wait 6 seconds if the port remains up/up; if a hardware failure or something else causes the port to go down, the switch will react immediately\u0097no need to wait 6 seconds.",

        "explanation": "The VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP) pruning feature of Cisco VTP allows switches to dynamically delete or add VLANs to a trunk. It restricts unnecessary traffic, such as broadcasts, to only those switches that have user machines connected for a particular VLAN. It is not required to flood a frame to a neighboring switch if that switch does not have any active ports in the source VLAN. A trunk can also be manually configured with its allowed VLANs, as an alternative to VTP pruning.",

The alternative port will surely belong to Switch4.\nSwitch4 will need to block one of its ports to avoid a bridging loop between the two switches. But how does Switch4 select its blocked port?

Each instance of PVST+ on a VLAN has a single root switch. This root switch propagates the spanning-tree information associated with that VLAN to all other switches in the network. Because each switch has the same information about the network, this process ensures that the network topology is maintained and optimized per VLAN.\nReference: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/switches/lan/catalyst3750x_3560x/software/release/12.2_55_se/configuration/guide/swstp.html",

To overcome this problem, in 2001, the IEEE with document 802.1w introduced an evolution of the Spanning Tree Protocol: Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP), which significantly reduces the convergence time after a topology change occurs in the network. While STP can take 30 to 50 seconds to transit from a blocking state to a forwarding state, RSTP is typically able to respond less than 10 seconds of a physical link failure.",

Select the root port on the non-root bridge, which can be completed through comparing root path cost. The smallest will be selected as the root port.\n3. Next, select the Designated Port. First, compare the path cost, if the costs happen to be the same, then compare the BID, still the smallest will be selected. Each link has a DP.

If two bridges have equal priority then the MAC addresses are compared; for example, if switches A (MAC=0200.0000.1111) and B (MAC=0200.0000.2222) both have a priority of 32768 then switch A will be selected as the root bridge.\nIn this case, 32768: 11-22-33-44-55-66 would be the bridge because it has a lower priority and MAC address.",

        "explanation": "Switches create separate collision domains for each port, which virtually eliminates collisions on a modern switched network. A high port density switch allows many devices to be connected without collisions, thus alleviating congestion caused by them.",

        "explanation": "The SVI (Switched Virtual Interface) inter-VLAN routing method is performed by a multilayer switch. Because the routing is handled in hardware (ASICs), it is much faster than the router-on-a-stick method. Since the switch itself performs the routing, there is no need for an external router connection for inter-VLAN communication.",
